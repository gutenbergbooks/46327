<h3>NEW YORK AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION,</h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Geneva, N. Y.</span>, <i>January 12, 1915</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>To the Honorable Board of Control of the New York Agricultural Experiment
Station</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript
copy for Part II of the 33d Annual Report of this Station. This
contribution is the fourth monograph on the fruits of New York State,
prepared under your direction by the Horticulturist of this institution
and his associates.</p>

<p>The cherry, which this manuscript discusses, is undoubtedly most
widely grown of the tree-fruits of the State; for within easy reach of every
rural housewife&mdash;in orchard or garden, along roadside or lane&mdash;the
"pie cherry" will be found; and many a lawn, even in village or city,
is graced by the stately trees which bear the delicious Yellow Spanish
or Black Tartarian. In many parts of the State, also, cherry growing
is an industry of much commercial importance, with orchards exceeded
in value by those of the apple and peach alone.</p>

<p>Because of its widespread popularity and commercial importance
the cherry well merits treatment in this place in the series of monographs.
It is hoped and believed that the growers and lovers of the fruit will appreciate
and utilize to good advantage the result here presented of years of
painstaking work by the authors. The discussions are based not alone
on Station experience with hundreds of the thousand or more varieties
described, but as well upon the collected observations of many cherry
growers and the expressed judgments of the leading pomologists who
have been interested in this fruit.</p>

<h2 id="Preface">PREFACE</h2>

<p>This is the fourth of the monographs on the fruits of temperate North
America published by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station.
The nature and purposes of these treatises have been set forth in the prefaces
of preceding volumes, but a summary of the purposes, with needed
emphasis on several, is given for the convenience of all readers and the
enlightenment of those who may not have the first three books.</p>

<p><cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> contains an historical account of cultivated
cherries, the botany of this fruit, a statement of its present economic status in
America, descriptions of all known varieties of cherries, the synonymy and
bibliography of the species and varieties, and biographical sketches of the persons
who have contributed materially to cherry culture in America. The most
important varieties are illustrated in colors. Everything that was thought
would be helpful in breeding cherries has been included, and special search
has been made for such material. So, too, whatever was thought to be
of interest to students of ecology and of plant distribution has been added.</p>

<p>In the monographs on grapes and plums it was necessary to devote
much space to the botanical relationship of these fruits since each contains
more than a score of species under cultivation, some of which are scarcely
known and most of which are extremely variable. The botany of cultivated
cherries is comparatively simple and has been made plain by botanical
writers. Yet the contemplation of the several species from a horticultural
standpoint adds something, we believe, to the botany of cherries, especially
as concerns the forms of the Sweet Cherry and the Sour Cherry which
have been variously treated by botanists.</p>

<p>As compared with their congeners, especially the plums, the economic
species of cherries are remarkably well delimited, showing far less responsiveness
to environment and having seemingly less inherent variation, so
that there need be little confusion in botanical classification. On the other
hand varieties are so similar that it is only with the greatest difficulty that
closely related sorts are distinguished and there is great confusion in the
synonymy, the chief task of the present work being to distinguish the true
names from the synonyms of the varieties described.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite>, as in the preceding fruit books from this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
Station, effort has been made to give as accurately as possible the region
in which the species and varieties grow best and to set forth fully the local
prejudices of the fruits. Such knowledge cannot but be of value in determining
the factors which govern the distribution of plants. The establishment
of community relationships and description of plant communities now
constitute an important part of botany on the one side and of geography on
the other. No phenomena give better expression of the climate and the soil
of a region than plant communities. When monographs of several of the
fruits of temperate North America shall have been completed, with statements
of likes and dislikes of the fruits and their varieties as to climate
and soil, material should be available to establish plant communities from
which can be drawn valuable generalizations.</p>

<p>All, howsoever interested in pomology, are dependent upon descriptions
of fruits. A well-made description of a fruit, to one mentally equipped
to interpret it, is second only, in the study of pomology, to having the fruit
itself. With but few exceptions the descriptions of the major varieties
are made first hand from cherries growing on the Station grounds, though
in many cases fruits from different localities have been compared with
those home-grown.</p>

<p>Since there are fewer varieties of cherries than of plums, it has been
possible to describe and illustrate a greater proportion of the sorts under
cultivation than in the book on plums, yet a selection has had to be made
of the worthiest of the many kinds. The choice of sorts for full descriptions
and color-plates has been determined: (1) By the present value of the
variety; (2) the probable value if the variety be a novelty; (3) by the
value of the data to the cherry breeder; (4) because of historical value&mdash;to
show what the trend of cherry evolution has been; (5) to show the
relationships of species and varieties. The varieties not illustrated nor fully
described are divided into two further groups in accordance with the same
considerations.</p>

<p>In botanical nomenclature the code adopted by the International
Botanical Congress, held at Vienna in 1905, has been used. In the use
of horticultural names we have followed somewhat closely the rules of the
American Pomological Society, though in many cases strict observance of
these rules, poor at best, would have added to rather than lessened the
confusion in horticultural nomenclature and, therefore, they have been
honored in the breach rather than in the observance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span></p>

<p>The references given are those that have been of use in ascertaining
the history, the economic status, or the description of the variety that
follows&mdash;no more, no fewer. These constitute a very small proportion of
the references that have been read&mdash;a tremendous task involving two or
three years' work for several persons.</p>

<p>So, too, it has been a herculean task to search out the synonyms of
cherries. French, German, English and American books on pomology
overflow with such synonyms and all in a state of "confusion worse confounded."
An enormous amount of work has been done in trying to
bring order out of this confusion. Many of the synonyms of varieties
have been given in times past because of adaptations to local environment.
Such naming of ecologic forms is not an unmixed evil, since it
draws attention to variable varieties and characters which otherwise might
be overlooked.</p>

<p>Under the ferment of Mendelian and De Vriesian ideas we seem to be
at the beginning of an era of great improvement of plants. There have
never been well-directed efforts to improve fruits, yet something has been
done with all. Now, when there is an onrush of new discoveries in plant-breeding,
seems to be a particularly opportune time to tell all that can be
learned about how cherries have been brought from their wild state to their
present perfection. This we try to do in giving the origin and history of
varieties, especially as to parentage and manner of origin, though such
information is scant and very fragmentary.</p>

<p>As in the previous fruit books some prominence is given in foot-notes
to biography. A knowledge of the career of those who have been giants
in their day in the development of any industry is most helpful to the best
understanding, indeed, is almost indispensable to the fullest comprehension,
of the industry. The short foot-notes, it is hoped, will serve to give some
conception of what the master builders in pomology were like in training,
character, and methods of work. From the reception which these sketches
in former fruit books have received, the writers feel that the considerable
expenditure of time and thought that these biographical notices have
required is amply justified and that the effort to give credit due and
some small honor to the promoters of pomology has been well worth while.</p>

<p>For aid in the preparation of <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> I am especially
indebted to those whose names appear on the title page, to my associate,
Mr. R. D. Anthony, for reading proof; to the Station editor, Mr. F. H.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
Hall, who has had charge of the proof reading; to Zeese-Wilkinson Company,
New York City, who have had an especially difficult task in making
the color-plates and who have done the work well; and to the J. B. Lyon
Company, Albany, New York, for their painstaking work in printing the
book.</p>

CULTIVATED CHERRIES</h2>

<h3>CHERRIES AND THEIR KINDRED</h3>

<p>The genus Prunus plays a very important part in horticulture. It
furnishes, in temperate climates, the stone-fruits, plants of ancient and modern
agriculture of which there are a score or more commonly cultivated and
at least as many more sparingly grown for their edible fruits. Of these
stone-fruits the species of cherries rank with those of the plum and the
peach in commercial importance while the several botanical groups of the
apricot and almond are less important, but hardly less well-known, members
of this notable genus. Prunus is of interest, too, because the history of
its edible species follows step by step the history of agriculture. The
domestication of its fruits from wild progenitors, most of which are still
subjects of common observation, illustrates well the influences and conditions
under which plants have generally been brought into domestication.
The genus is also of more than ordinary note because the number of its
economic species is being increased almost yearly by new-found treasures
from North America and Asia, not varieties but species, which promise
under future domestication still further to enrich horticulture.</p>

<p>The plum and the peach surpass the cherry in diversity of flavor,
aroma, texture, color, form and size, characters which make fruits pleasant
to the palate and beautiful to the eye; but the cherry, perhaps, plays a
more important part than the plum or the peach in domestic economy. It
has fewer prejudices as to soil and climate, hence is much more widely
distributed and is more easily grown, being better represented in the orchards
and gardens in the regions where the three fruits grow. The cherry,
too, fruits more quickly after planting, ripens earlier in the season and its
varieties are more regular in bearing and usually more fruitful&mdash;characters
that greatly commend it to fruit-growing people. Probably it is the
most popular of all fruits for the garden, dooryard, roadside and small
orchard. All in all, while adorning a somewhat humbler place in pomology,
it is more generally useful than the showier and more delicate plum and
peach.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>Though placed by most botanists in the same genus, each of the stone-fruits
constitutes a natural group so distinct that neither botanist nor fruit-grower
could possibly take one for another as the trees and fruits of the different
groups are called to mind. But there are outstanding forms which
seem to establish connections between the many species and the several
groups of fruits and through these outliers the characters are so confounded
in attempting to separate species that it becomes quickly apparent that there
are few distinct lines of cleavage within the genus. For several centuries
systematists have disputed as to whether the stone-fruits fall most naturally
into one, two, or three genera&mdash;indeed have not been able to agree as to
whether some species are plums or cherries, or others apricots or plums.
Hybridization between the cultivated divisions of the genus&mdash;unquestionably
it has taken place in nature as well&mdash;has added to the perplexities
of classification. Accepting, then, for the present at least, the very artificial
classification which, rather paradoxically, places in one genus a number of
fruits commonly thought of as quite distinct, let us briefly note the characters
which best distinguish cherries from their congeners.</p>

<p>The cherry is nearest of kin to the plum. These two are roughly
separated from the other cultivated members of the genus to which they
belong by bearing their fruits on stems in fascicles while the others are
practically stemless and are solitary or borne in pairs. The fruits of plums
and cherries are globular or oblong, succulent and smooth or nearly so.
Peaches, apricots, nectarines and almonds are more sulcate than plums and
cherries and the almond has a drier flesh, splitting at maturity to liberate
the stone; and, with the exception of nectarines and a few varieties of
apricots, all are very pubescent. The stones of cherries and plums are
smooth, or nearly so, while those of the other fruits are sculptured and
pitted, though those of the apricot are often somewhat plum-like.</p>

<p>Cherries are separated from plums by their smaller size and distinctive
color of skin, juice and flesh; by the texture and distinct flavor of the flesh;
by growth in corymbose rather than umbelliferous fascicles; by the more
globular stone; and by the arrangement of the leaves in the bud. Leaves
of the plum are usually convolute, or rolled up, in the bud, while those of
the cherry are conduplicate, or folded lengthwise along the midrib.</p>

<p>We have been discussing the cherries of common cultivation&mdash;the
Sweet Cherry and Sour Cherry of the orchards, the fascicled cherries to
which the botanists give the group name, Cerasus. But there is another
group, the Padus cherries, well worthy of brief mention. The most noteworthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
representatives of Padus are the bird cherry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus padus</i>) of
the Old World and the choke cherry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus virginiana</i>) of the New World.
These Padus cherries are distinguished botanically in having their flowers
borne in racemes, that is, in long clusters of which those nearest the base
of the shoot open first&mdash;rather than in the short-clustered fascicles of the
Cerasus group. The cherries are small and almost or quite black. The
Padus cherries are but sparingly cultivated but undoubtedly they are
capable of some improvement under more thorough cultivation.</p>

<h3>DISTRIBUTION OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES</h3>

<p>The cherry is one of the most commonly cultivated of all fruits and
the many varieties of its several forms encircle the globe in the North
Temperate Zone and are being rapidly disseminated throughout the temperate
parts of the Southern Hemisphere. For centuries it has been, as
we shall see in the history of the species, one of the most valuable fruit-producing
trees of Europe and Asia&mdash;an inhabitant of nearly every
orchard and garden as well as a common roadside tree in temperate climates
in both continents. From Europe, as a center of distribution, the cherry
has played an important part in the orcharding in temperate regions of
other continents. In North America varieties of the cherry are grown
from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island on the north, to the Gulf of California,
Texas and Florida on the south, yielding fruit in a greater diversity
of soils and climates in Canada and the States of the Union than any other
tree-fruit.</p>

<p>The Sour Cherry is very cosmopolitan, thriving in many soils; is able
to withstand heat, cold and great atmospheric dryness, if the soil contain
moisture; and, though it responds to good care, it grows under neglect
better than any other tree-fruit. The Sour Cherry, too, is rather less
inviting to insects and fungi than most other stone-fruits, being practically
immune to the dreaded San José scale. On the other hand the Sweet
Cherry is very fastidious as to soils, is lacking in hardiness to both heat
and cold and is prey to many insects and subject to all the ills to which
stone-fruits are heir; it is grown at its best in but few and comparatively
limited areas, though these are very widely distributed.</p>

<h3>USES OF THE CHERRY</h3>

<p>The cherry is a delectable early-summer fruit, especially grateful as a
refreshing dessert and much valued in cookery, when fresh, canned, preserved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
or dried, for the making of pies, tarts, sauces and confections. During
the last few years, in America at least, the consumption of cherries
has been enormously increased by the fashion of adding preserved cherries,
as much for ornament as to give flavor, to many drinks and ices. The
great bulk of the cherry crop now grown in America for commercial purposes
is canned, the industry being more or less specialized in a few fruit regions.
The demand for cherries for canning seems to be increasing greatly but
unfortunately it calls for but few varieties, the Montmorency being the
sort sought for among the Sour Cherries, while the hard-fleshed varieties
of the Bigarreau type are in greatest demand among the Sweet Cherries.</p>

<p>The cherry, while a very common fruit in nearly all agricultural regions
of America, does not hold the place in American markets as a fresh fruit
that it does in the towns and cities of Europe. The great abundance of
strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, dewberries, blackberries,
as well as early varieties of tree fruits, makes keener here than abroad the
competition in the fruit markets during cherry time. The fact, too, that
market fruits in America are shipped long distances, for which the cherry
is not well adapted, helps to explain the relatively small regard in which
this fruit has been held for commercial purposes in the fresh state. In
recent years, however, both Sweet Cherries and Sour Cherries, the former
in particular, have been sent to the markets in far greater abundance, the
impetus to their market value being due to a better product&mdash;better
varieties, hence greater demand&mdash;and to greatly improved facilities for
shipping and holding for sale.</p>

<p>In Europe several liqueurs are very commonly made from cherries
both for home and commercial uses. Such is not the case in America,
where, except in very limited quantities in which unfermented cherry
juices are used in the home, this fruit is not used in liqueur-making. In
some of the countries of Europe, wine is made from the juice; a spirit,
kirschwasser,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is distilled from the fermented pulp as an article for both
home and commerce; and ratafias and cordials are very generally flavored
with cherries. In the Austrian province of Dalmatia a liqueur or cordial
called maraschino<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> is made by a secret process of fermentation and distillation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
This liqueur is imported in America in considerable quantities to
flavor preservatives in which the home-grown cherries are prepared for use
in various drinks and confections. No attempts have been made to grow
the Marasca cherry on a commercial scale in America but undoubtedly it
could be grown and, with the process of making maraschino discovered, an
important use would be developed for cherries&mdash;all the more to be desired
since the foreign maraschino is now grossly adulterated and imitated in
this country. Both the fruits and seeds of cherries, especially of the
Mahaleb, are steeped in spirits for food, drink and medicinal purposes. An
oil used in making perfumes for scenting soaps and confectionery is also
extracted from the seeds of the Mahaleb because of which use this species
is often called the "Perfumed Cherry."</p>

<p>In the old herbals and pomologies much is made of the value of cherries
for medicinal purposes. The fruit was supposed to be a sovereign remedy
for various ailments of the digestive tract as well as for nervous disorders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and epilepsy. The astringent leaves and bark, or extracts from them,
were much used by the ancients in medicine and are still more or less
employed both as home remedies and in the practice of medicine as mild
tonics and sedatives. One of the active chemicals of the leaf, seed
and bark is hydrocyanic acid to which is largely due the peculiar odor of
these structures. A gum is secreted from the trunks of cherry trees,
known in commerce as cerasin, which has some use in medicine and in
various trades as well, especially as a substitute and as an adulterant of
gum arabic.</p>

<p>At least three cultivated cherry trees produce wood of considerable
value. The wood of the cherry is hard, close-grained, solid, durable, a
handsome pale red, or brown tinged with red. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, the Sweet
Cherry, furnishes a wood which, if sufficient care be taken to season it, is
of much value in cabinet-making and for the manufacture of musical
instruments. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i> is a much smaller tree than the former but
its wood, as much as there is of it, is even more valuable, being very hard
and fragrant and dark enough in color to take on a beautiful mahogany-like
polish. In France the wood of the Mahaleb cherry is held in high
esteem, under the name <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois de St. Lucie</i>, in cabinet-making and for toys,
canes, handles and especially for the making of tobacco pipes. In Japan
the wood of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pseudocerasus</i> is said to be in great demand for
engraving and in making the blocks used in printing cloth and wall-paper.
In America the wood of the orchard species of cherries is seldom used for
domestic purposes, that of the wild species being so much more cheaply
obtainable and serving all purposes quite as well.</p>

<p>To people who know it only for its fruit, the cherry does not appear
particularly desirable as an ornamental. But wild and cultivated cherries
furnish many beautiful trees in a genus peculiar for the beauty of its species.
The color and abundance of the flowers, fruits and leaves of the cultivated
cherries and the fact that they are prolific of forms with double flowers,
weeping, fastigiate or other ornamental habits, make the several species
of this plant valuable as ornamentals. Besides, they are vigorous and rapid
in growth, hardy, easy of culture, comparatively free from pests and
adapted to a great diversity of soils and climates. Both the ornamental
and the edible cherries are very beautiful in spring when abundantly
covered with flowers, which usually open with the unfolding leaves, as
well as throughout the summer when overspread with lustrous green foliage
and most of them are quite as conspicuously beautiful in the autumn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
when the leaves turn from green to light and dark tints of red. All will
agree that a cherry tree in full fruit is a most beautiful object. In the
winter when the leaves have fallen, some of the trees, especially of the
ornamental varieties, are very graceful and beautiful, others are often
picturesque, and even the somewhat stiff and formal Sweet Cherries are
attractive plants in the garden or along the roadside.</p>

<p>Very acceptable jellies, sauces and preserves are made from several of
the wild cherries in the Padus group. The peasantry of the Eastern Hemisphere
have in times of need found them important foods as have also the
American Indians at all times. The fruits of some of the species of Padus
are quite commonly used in flavoring liqueurs and on both continents are
sometimes fermented and distilled into a liqueur similar to kirschwasser.
The bark of different parts of the trees of this group is valuable in medicine&mdash;at
least is largely used. The trees of several species form handsome
ornamentals and some of them are in commerce for the purpose. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
serotina</i>, one of the group, because of the strength of its wood and the
beautiful satiny polish which its surface is capable of receiving, is a valuable
timber tree of American forests. For the products of the members of this
group, as just set forth, the domestication of some of the species of Padus
might well be pushed.</p>

<h3>LITERATURE OF THE CHERRY</h3>

<p>Despite the important part they have played in orcharding since the
domestication of fruits in temperate zones, as shown by their history and
their present popularity, pomological writers have singularly neglected
cherries. There are relatively few European books devoted to them and
in America, while there are treatises on all others of the common tree-fruits,
the cherry alone seems not to have inspired some pomologist to print a
book. Neither are the discussions in general pomologies as full and accurate
as for other fruits. The reason for this neglect is that the cherry,
until the last decade or two, has scarcely been a fruit of commerce, having
been grown almost entirely for home use or at most for the local market.
As a result of this neglect of the cherry by students of pomology, we have
no authoritative nor serviceable system of classification of the varieties of
cherries and the nomenclature of this fruit is in an appalling state of confusion,
as a glance at the synonymy of some of the older varieties discussed
in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> will show.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<h3>AMELIORATION OF THE CHERRY</h3>

<p>The amelioration of the cherry has been in progress almost since
the dawn of civilization, yet few men have directed their efforts toward
the improvement of this fruit. The histories of the varieties described
in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> show that nearly all of them have come
from chance seedlings. Possibly there has been little interest in
improving cherries because this fruit is comparatively immutable in its
characters.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that there are a great number of varieties, 1,145
being described in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite>, this of all stone-fruits is most
fixed in its characters. The differences between tree and fruit in the many
varieties are less marked than in the other fruits of Prunus and the varieties
come more nearly true to seed. Though probably domesticated as long
ago as any other of the tree-fruits, the cherry is now most of all like its
wild progenitors. The plum is very closely related to the cherry but it
has varied in nature and under cultivation much more than the cherry
and in accordance with different environments has developed more marked
differences in its species to endure the conditions brought about by the
topographical and climatic changes through which the earth has passed.
Under domestication more than twice as many orchard varieties of the
plum have come into being as of the cherry. In spite of this stability,
there are ample rewards in breeding cherries to those who will put in practice
rightly directed efforts to improve this fruit&mdash;a statement substantiated
by the histories of some of the best varieties, described later in this
text, which were originated through what was passing as current coin in
plant-breeding before the far better methods of the present time, brought
about by Mendel's discovery, came into being.</p>

<p>The cherry, as the histories of its many diverse kinds show, has been
improved only through new varieties. There is no evidence, whatever, to
show that any one of the several hundred cherries described in this text
has been improved by selection as a cumulative process, or, on the other
hand, that any one of them has cumulatively degenerated. Of varieties
cultivated for their fruits there are no records of mutations either from the
seed or from bud, though of the ornamental cherries not a few have arisen
as bud-mutations, as, for example, the several double-flowered cherries and
those of weeping or fastigiate habit of growth and the many sorts with
abnormally colored foliage. Since improvement depends upon the bringing
into being of new cherries it becomes highly important to know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
how the varieties we are dealing with in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite>
have come into existence. The following is a summary of their manner
of origin:&mdash;</p>

<p>No case is recorded in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> of a variety known
to have come from self-fertilized seed.</p>

<p>The seed parent is given for 61 varieties. The statements as to seed
parents are probably accurate, for a man planting cherry seeds would
record the name of the seed parent correctly if he knew it.</p>

<p>The seed and pollen parents of twenty of the cherries described in this
work are given. Sixteen of these are hybrids originating with Professor
N. E. Hansen of South Dakota, leaving but four sorts the parents of which
were known before the recent work of Professor Hansen.</p>

<p>No cherry cultivated for its fruit is reported to have come from a sport
or a bud-mutation.</p>

<p>Cherries arising from seed sown without knowledge of either parent or
from natural seedlings are put down as chance seedlings; of these there
are 147.</p>

<p>The origin of 917 of the varieties here described is unknown.</p>

<p>The total number of cherries under discussion is 1,145.</p>

<p>To improve the cherry the breeder must know the material with which
he is working. The following is a brief discussion of the characters of this
fruit to be found in the technical descriptions of species and varieties.</p>

<h3>TREE AND FRUIT CHARACTERS OF THE CHERRY</h3>

<p>Species of cherries have very characteristic trees. The merest glance
at the tree enables one to tell the Sweet Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, from the
Sour Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>. The first named is the larger of the two,
especially reaching a greater height, is pyramidal in shape, with branches
erect and bearing much less foliage than the Sour Cherry. The Sweet
Cherry often lives for a century or more&mdash;the Sour Cherry attains but
the three score years and ten of man. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> is easily distinguished
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> by its comparatively low, roundish and never
pyramidal head. So, too, many of the varieties of either of these two
species are readily told in the orchard by the size or habit of the plant.
Other species are either shrubby or tree-like and their varieties may often
be identified from the spaciousness or dwarfness of its trees. Size is rather
more variable than other gross characters because of the influence of
environment&mdash;food, moisture, light, isolation, pests and the like&mdash;yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
size in a plant, or in the parts of a plant, is a very reliable character when
proper allowances have been made for environment.</p>

<p>Habit of growth, unlike size, varies but little with changing conditions
and thus becomes a most important means of distinguishing species and
varieties and not infrequently sets the seal and sign of desirability for an
orchard cherry. More than any other character, habit of growth gives
what is called "aspect" to a cherry tree. Thus, a species or a variety
may be upright, spreading, round-topped, drooping or weeping in habit of
growth; the head may be open or dense and may be formed by a central
shaft with several whorls of branches or by three or four trunk-like stems
each with its scaffolding branches. The trees may grow rapidly or slowly
and may be long-lived or short-lived. The trunks may be short and stocky,
or long and slender, straight or crooked, gnarled or smooth, these characters
often determining whether a cherry is manageable or unmanageable in the
orchard.</p>

<p>The degree of hardiness is a very important diagnostic character for
groups of cherries and often wholly indicates their value for agriculture.
Thus, the varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> are but little hardier than the peach
while those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> are as hardy or hardier than the apple. The
range of varieties as to hardiness falls within that of the species and it is
interesting to note that in Europe, where the wild <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> is very
common, in the many centuries since the fruit has been under domestication,
a cultivated variety hardier than the wild Sweet Cherry has not been
developed. Cherries are designated in the technical descriptions as hardy,
half-hardy and tender.</p>

<p>Productiveness, age of bearing, and regularity of bearing are distinctive
and valuable characters of orchard cherries but not of wild cherries. The
care given the tree greatly influences fruitfulness, yet the quantity of fruit
produced is often a helpful means of identifying a variety and is a character
that must always be considered by the plant-breeder. Age of bearing
and regularity of bearing are most important characters with the pome
fruits, the apple, in particular, but while worth considering with the
drupes are of relatively little value, all drupaceous fruits coming in bearing
at about the same time for the species and all bearing regularly, as a
rule, unless interfered with by some outside agency preventing the setting
or causing the dropping of fruit.</p>

<p>Immunity and susceptibility to diseases and insects are valuable
taxonomic characters of both species and varieties of cultivated cherries.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Thus, the varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> are very susceptible to black knot
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plowrightia morbosa</i>), while those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> are almost immune.
On the other hand, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> is an inviting prey to San José scale
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus perniciosus</i>), while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> is but little injured, indeed,
seldom attacked; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i> appears to be almost wholly immune to
the powdery mildew (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Podosphaera oxyacanthae</i>), while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> are much attacked, though Wood, a variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
avium</i>, is almost immune. The English Morello, a variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
cerasus</i>, is very subject to leaf spot (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cylindrosporium padi</i>), while Montmorency,
of the same species, is nearly immune. These examples can
be multiplied many times by references to the discussions of varieties,
and represent only observations on the grounds and in the neighborhood
of this Station. They serve to show the great importance, to the fruit-grower,
the plant-breeder and the systematist, of natural resistance to
disease and insects.</p>

<p>Both the outer and the inner bark have considerable value in determining
species but are of little importance in identifying varieties and
have no economic value to the fruit-grower and hence but little to the
breeder. Smoothness, color, thickness and manner of exfoliation are the
attributes of the outer bark to be noted, while the color of the inner bark
is the only determinant and that relatively unimportant. In young trees
the bark of the cherry of all species is smooth, glossy or even brilliant;
but later it becomes uneven, scaly and dull, usually ash-gray but varying
in all of these characters to an extent well worth noting for taxonomic
purposes. Cherries, in common with most trees, have a lighter colored
bark in cold than in warm regions, and in dry than in wet areas.</p>

<p>Branches and branchlets are very characteristic in both species and
varieties. The length, thickness, direction, rigidity and the branching
angle are valuable determining characters and very stable ones, changing
but little even with marked variations of soil and climate. Thus, a Sweet
Cherry tree can be told from a tree of the Sour Cherry, or the English
Morello can be distinguished from Montmorency by branch characters as
far as the outlines of the trees are discernible. Few cherries bear spines
but all are more or less spurred and these spurs are quite characteristic
even in varieties. With the branchlets the length of the internodes should
be considered and their direction, whether straight or zigzag; also color,
smoothness, amount of pubescence, size and appearance of the lenticels,
the presence of excrescences, are all to be noted in careful study though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
all are more or less variable, pubescence especially so, this character
being too often relied upon in descriptions by European botanists and
pomologists.</p>

<p>Leaf-buds vary greatly in different species in size, shape, color of
the buds and of their outer and inner scales and in the outline of the
scales. The angle at which the bud stands out from the branchlet is of
some taxonomic value. Vernation, or the disposition of the leaf-blade in
the bud, is a fine mark of distinction in separating the cherry from other
stone-fruits and while all cherry leaves are supposed to be conduplicate,
that is, folded by the midrib so that the two halves are face to face, yet
there are slight but important differences in the conduplication of the
leaves in both species and varieties. The manner of bearing buds&mdash;whether
single, in pairs, or in rosettes&mdash;must be taken into account, with
species at least, and differences in shape and position of leaf and fruit-buds
must be noted.</p>

<p>Leaves in their season are very evident and either collectively or
individually are valuable determinants of species and varieties. Fruit-growers
take little note of leaves, however, though they should be taken
into practical account, since their size and number often indicate the
degree of vigor. The variability of leaves is usually within limits easily
set and occurs most often in young plants, in extremes of soil and
climate, and on very succulent growths or water-sprouts. Leaf-size is the
most variable character of this organ but is yet dependable in separating
several species, as, for example, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, the
leaves being very much larger in the former than in the latter species.
Leaf-forms are very constant in species and varieties, hence especially
valuable in classification.</p>

<p>Much care has been taken to illustrate accurately the size and form
of cherry leaves in the color-plates in this text but it is impossible to
reproduce by color-printing the tints of the leaves, though these are quite
constant in both species and varieties.</p>

<p>Other characters of leaves taken into account in describing cherries
are thickness, roughness, and pubescence, all of which are somewhat
variable, being greatly influenced by climate and soil. Quite too much
stress is laid upon the value of pubescence on leaves in determining groups,
unless comparisons can be made between plants growing in the same
habitat. Possibly more important than any other part of the leaf-blade,
in the study of species at least, is the margin. This in the cherry is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
always serrated and often sub-serrated. These serrations are best studied
at the middle of the sides of the leaves, those at the base and apex often
being crowded or wanting.</p>

<p>The petiole may be used to good advantage in distinguishing both
species and varieties. Thus, in consequence of the great length and slenderness
of the petiole of leaves of Sweet Cherries, the leaves are always more
or less drooping, while those of the Sour Cherry are usually erect by reason
of the petiole being short and strong. The color of the petiole is said
by some to be correlated with that of the fruit&mdash;a statement that needs
verification. The pubescence of the petiole must be noted.</p>

<p>The position, size, shape and color of the glands on cherry leaves
must be noted as they are fairly constant guides. They are usually on
the petiole at the base of the leaf but are sometimes on the leaf itself.
The glands are commonly given as globular or reniform in shape but there
are often intermediate forms the shape of which is hard to classify.</p>

<p>Stipules in this plant have considerable taxonomic value, having some
distinguishing marks not possessed by the leaves. Cherry leaves springing
from dormant leaf-buds have very small stipules, sometimes so minute
as hardly to be seen, but on the current year's growth the stipules are
larger, being largest at the tip of the branchlet. There is considerable
difference in the size of these organs in varieties of the same species.
Stipules of the cherry are nearly always borne in pairs. The small stipules,
appearing with the first leaves, drop, at this Station, about the middle of
June while those accompanying the later leaves on the wood growth of
the current year remain until in July, there being a difference in varieties
as to how long they remain. All stipules are deeply toothed and bear
glands of varying color and shape on the serrations, the characters of
both serrations and glands offering some distinguishing marks for species
and varieties.</p>

<p>The flowers of cherries are very characteristic, as a study of the color-plates
of blossoms will show, furnishing a wholly distinctive mark of
species and helping to distinguish varieties. The flowers are hermaphrodites
and are borne in more or less dense, corymbose clusters. Individual
flowers in species and varieties vary in size, shape, color and odor. The
peduncles are long or short, as the case may be; the corolla furnishes
distinctions in size, shape and color of petals; the calyces are chiefly distinguished
by their glands and the amount and character of the pubescence;
while stamens and pistils offer differences in size, color of their different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
parts and in the number of stamens. In plums the reproductive organs
differ greatly in ability to perform their functions, some varieties being
self-sterile. In New York there seem to be no marked differences in
fecundity in cherries nor are there so frequently the malformations of
reproductive organs which are found in plums. The season of flowering
is a fine mark of distinction between species and varieties, a fact well
brought out by the chart on pages 80-81.</p>

<p>Of all organs, the fruit of the cherry is most responsive to changed
conditions and hence most variable, yet the fruits furnish very valuable
taxonomic characters in both botany and pomology. In pomology, in
particular, the fruits must be closely studied. Size, shape, color, bloom,
stem, cavity, apex, suture and skin are the outward characters of which
note must be made; while the color, aroma, flavor and texture of the flesh
are usually very characteristic. Both species and varieties are well distinguished
by the time of ripening though there is much variation in
ripening dates. The keeping quality is scarcely taken into account with
cherries but varies a great deal, chiefly in accordance with firmness of the
flesh. The flesh of cherries, as in all drupaceous fruits, clings to the stone
or is wholly or partly free&mdash;a character of interest both to the systematist
and to the fruit-grower. The color of the juice, whether colorless or red,
is a plain and certain dividing line in both species and varieties.</p>

<p>The pits of cherries are rather more lacking in distinction than in
other stone-fruits, plums for example, yet they must be accounted of
considerable value in determination and for this reason have been included
in all of the color-plates of varieties. Cherry-pits from individual trees
are almost lacking in differences except in size but between species and
varieties show many distinctions not only in size but in shape, surfaces,
grooves and ridges, in the ends and more or less in the seeds within.
Cherries of any variety grown on poor soils or in incongenial climates
tend to have large stones and little flesh, while the pits are smaller and
there is more flesh with the opposite extremes in environment. As will be
pointed out in the discussion of the group of cherries known as the Dukes,
many varieties have pits with shrunken and abortive seeds coming, as we
think, from the hybrid origin of these cherries.</p>

<p>The several pages given to the discussion of the characters of cherries
are in preparation for a proper understanding of the classifications and
descriptions of species and varieties. We are now ready for the classification
of the species of cherries which contribute or may contribute forms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
for cultivation either for their fruits or as stocks upon which to grow
edible cherries. The following is a brief conspectus of the edible species
of Prunus followed by a fuller conspectus of the sub-genus Cerasus to
which cherries belong.</p>

<h3>A CLASSIFICATION OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES</h3>

<p>The genus Prunus is variously delimited and divided by systematic
botanists. A simple, and from a horticultural point of view, a very satisfactory
classification, is to put almonds and peaches in one sub-genus
(Amygdalus), cherries in a second (Cerasus), plums and apricots in a third
(Euprunus), and to place the racemose cherries and cherry-laurels, usually
considered in Prunus, in another genus, Padus. In this division of Prunus
into three sub-genera we may assign to each the following characters.</p>

<p class="hang5">A. Leaves convolute, <i>i. e.</i>, rolled in the bud (showing best in the opening buds).<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br />
<i>Euprunus.</i> Plums and apricots.</p>

<p class="hang3">A.A. Leaves conduplicate, <i>i. e.</i>, folded lengthwise along the midrib in the bud.</p>

<p class="hang9">B. Fruit more or less dry and hirsute; if juicy or glabrous the blossoms appear
long before the opening of the leaves; fruits without stems.<br />
<i>Amygdalus.</i> Almonds and peaches.</p>

<p class="hang8">B.B. Fruit always juicy and usually glabrous; blooms appearing with the leaves.<br />
<i>Cerasus.</i> Cherries.</p>

<p>Of these several divisions we are here concerned only with Cerasus,
to which belong all fascicled cherries, the racemose, or Padus, cherries as
yet having little or no value as esculents. The genus Prunus is from year
to year being enlarged by the discovery of new species, the additions to
Cerasus in particular being numerous. Thus, a decade ago, botanists
placed in this sub-genus, at the outside, not more than a score of species
but Koehne, the most recent monographer of Cerasus, describes 119 species.
Of Koehne's species at least a dozen are more or less cultivated for their
fruits and a score or more are grown as ornamentals.</p>

<p>The following species are listed by Koehne:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>

<p>The geographical distribution of these cherries is most interesting.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
From North America come but five species of cherries but two of which,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus besseyi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pumila</i>, furnish food and these two as yet
are but sparingly grown; all five, however, are more or less used as stocks.</p>

<p>Greene<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> has described, in addition to the five accepted ones, eleven new
species of true cherries from the far west of the type of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus emarginata</i>,
some of which at least have furnished food to the Indians, miners and
trappers and may have horticultural possibilities for the desert regions
in which they are found either for fruit or as stocks.</p>

<p>From the western portion of the Old World, including all of Europe,
northern Africa, Asia Minor, Persia, Turkestan and Afghanistan come 14
species. From this region, though the number of species as compared
with East Asia is small, we have all of the cultivated esculent cherries,
if possibly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus tomentosa</i> be excepted. Though nearly all of the species
of this large territory are found&mdash;possibly all originated there&mdash;in the
southeastern part of Europe and the adjoining southwestern part of Asia,
yet they seem, with one or two exceptions, to be quite distinct from the
species of the eastern half of the Old World&mdash;the Himalaya Mountains
separating the two regions. It is probable that when west central Asia
has been as well explored botanically as the east central part of the continent,
many new species will be added to Prunus and its sub-genus Cerasus.</p>

<p>It is in the eastern half of the Old World that the cherry flora is
richest. More than 100 of the 119 species of Cerasus recognized by Koehne
are found in the Himalaya Mountains and the region to the east including
Japan and the Kuril Islands. Yet out of all of this wealth of raw material
only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus tomentosa</i> has been truly domesticated as an esculent though
possibly a score of these species are well-known ornamentals. Of the
100 eastern Asiatic species about 75 belong to China&mdash;the remainder to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Formosa, Siam and Japan with its islands. Happily these Chinese cherries
are being introduced, but a few at a time, it is true, to Europe and
America and it can hardly be otherwise than that they will enrich horticulture
as they are domesticated, hybridized or used as a consort upon
which to grow the cherries now known to cultivation. In particular, it
may be expected that cherries for the cold north and the bleak plains of
our continent will be evolved from the Asiatic species better suited to
these regions than the cultivated cherries we now grow.</p>

<p>The number and diversity of the species of cherries which this brief
review of Cerasus shows to exist suggest that our cultivated cherry flora
is but begun. There can be no question but that others of these species
than the few that have been domesticated will yield to improvement under
cultivation and furnish refreshing fruits. It is just as certain that new
types, as valuable perhaps as the hybrid Dukes we now have, can be
produced through hybridization. In North America, we have no satisfactory
stock for cultivated Sweet and Sour Cherries. Both of the stocks
now commonly used, the Mazzard and the Mahaleb, as we shall see, have
weaknesses that unfit them for general use. Surely out of the great number
of forms we have just listed a better stock than either of the two
named can be found. No doubt, too, many of these new species, even
though they do not furnish food, will prove valuable timber or ornamental
trees.</p>

<p>We are ready now for a more detailed discussion of the cultivated
species of cherries.</p>

<p>The numerous synonyms of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> indicate the state of confusion
which prevails in the scientific nomenclature of the Sour Cherry.
Yet the names given are scarcely a tithe of those that have been discarded
or superseded for a whole or a part of this species by botanists. Happily,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
there is no language in which there is a possibility of confusing the Sour
Cherry with the other two or three species of cultivated cherries if the
common names be used. That men, learned or unlearned, speaking in
their mother tongues distinguish species of cherries so readily by their
common names, is ample excuse for not attempting to give in a pomological
work all of the Latin names of the Sour Cherry that have been used by
the many men who have at one time or another attempted to classify
the plants in Prunus. Those here published are from botanists who have
contributed most to the knowledge of the species.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> is the Sour Cherry, or Pie Cherry, of many languages&mdash;grown
and esteemed in temperate climates the world over and probably
the most widely distributed of all tree fruits. The species is found truly
wild, as we have set forth in detail in the following chapter, in southwestern
Asia and southeastern Europe. It is a frequent escape from
cultivation, multiplying from seed distributed by birds or human agencies
or growing from suckers which spring so freely from the roots as to make
the species unfit for a stock in orchard work. The number of cultivated
varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> listed in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> is 270.
Sour Cherries cultivated for their fruits constitute two distinct groups, each
of which is again divided into many varieties. The two groups vary
more or less in both tree and fruit but have a constant difference only
in a single, very easily distinguished character&mdash;the juice in the fruits
of one is red, in the other it is colorless.</p>

<p>The cherries with colorless juice are the Amarelles, from the Latin
for bitter, a term probably first used by the Germans but now in general
use wherever these cherries are grown, though the English often designate
them as Kentish cherries and the French as Cerisier Commun. These
Amarelles are pale red fruits, more or less flattened at the ends. Despite
the derivation of the name Amarelle, they have less bitterness than the
other group of varieties of the Sour Cherry. They are also less acid than
the darker colored cherries and are therefore more suitable for eating out
of hand while the dark colored cherries are almost exclusively culinary
fruits. The common representatives of this group are Early Richmond,
Montmorency and the various cherries to which the word Amarelle is
affixed, as the King Amarelle and the Späte Amarelle.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50" id="illus-026">
<a href="images/illus-026.jpg">
<img src="images/illus-026.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">PRUNUS CERASUS</i> (MORELLO GROUP)</p>
</div>

<p>The second group, varieties with reddish juice and usually with very
dark fruits which are more spherical or cordate in shape than the
Amarelles, comprises the Morellos of several languages or the Griottes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the French. The first of these terms has reference to the color, the word
Morello coming from the Italian meaning blackish while Griotte, from the
French, probably is derived through agriotte from aigre, meaning sharp,
in reference to the acidity of these cherries. Weichsel is the German
group name for these cherries, rather less commonly used than the other
two terms. The trees of the Morello-like varieties are usually smaller,
bushier and more compact than those of the Amarelles. The branches,
as a rule, are more horizontal, often drooping, are less regularly arranged
and are more slender. The leaves, in typical varieties, are smaller, thinner,
a darker green and are pendant while those of the Amarelles are either
inclined to be upright or horizontal; the leaves are also toothed less
deeply and more regularly. These differences in the leaves are well shown
in the color-plates of the varieties of the two groups. There are differences,
also, in the inflorescence and the floral organs in the extreme types
but these disappear in the varieties that connect the two forms. The
typical varieties of this group are English Morello, Ostheim, Olivet,
Brusseler Braune, Vladimir and Riga.</p>

<p>Attempts to give precise distinctions between the fruits and trees
of the two groups fail because the varieties constituting them hybridize
freely making it impossible, with the more or less blended characters, to
classify accurately. The group name indicates but little more than whether
the cherries have a colored or a colorless juice&mdash;a distinction well worth
while for the fruit-grower.</p>

<p>Ehrhart called Sour Cherries with colorless juice <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus acida</i> and
those with dark colored juice <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus austera</i>. To some extent botanists
have followed Ehrhart's designations. Linnaeus thought the two groups
sufficiently distinct to be botanical varieties of the species and denominated
the cherry with colorless juice <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus caproniana</i> and the
one with colored juice <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus austera</i>.</p>

<p>A third division of the species is the Marasca cherry from which is
made maraschino, a distilled liqueur much used in Europe as a drink and
in Europe and America in the manufacture of maraschino cherries. The
Marasca cherry is a native of the province of Dalmatia, Austria, where
the trees grow wild and are now sparingly cultivated. In 1831 Host
gave this form the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus marasca</i> and a year later Reichenbach
described it as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus marasca</i>. Botanists now very generally include it in
the species under discussion and Schneider<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> makes it a botanical variety,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus marasca</i>, a disposition which we believe to be the best.
The Marasca cherries differ from the other cultivated forms chiefly in
the greater vigor of the trees, relatively finer serrations of the leaves, longer
stipules and a more compact inflorescence. The fruits are much smaller
than in the common Sour Cherries, are deep red or almost black in color
and have intensely red flesh and juice. The cherries are very acid with a
bitter taste that gives flavor to the maraschino made from them.</p>

<p>Besides these divisions of the species cultivated for their fruits
botanists describe several botanical forms which either have no horticultural
value or are cultivated exclusively as ornamentals. It is not
necessary to discuss these in a pomological work. Of these botanical
derivatives of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, Schneider enumerates nine and three hybrids
between this and other species.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Through its cultivated varieties <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> is everywhere known in
temperate climates as the Sweet Cherry. In the wild state it is variously
called Mazzard, Bird, Wild, Crab and the Gean cherry. It is not as
hardy a species as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> and is, therefore, less generally grown but
still is a favorite orchard, dooryard and roadside plant in all mid-temperate
regions. It refuses to grow, however, in the warmest and coldest parts
of the temperate zones. Wherever the species thrives as an orchard
plant it is to be found growing spontaneously along fences and roadsides
and in open woods from seeds distributed by birds. The fruits of these
wild Sweet Cherries are usually small and the flesh thin and dry, often
unpalatable; but, on the other hand, trees are sometimes found as escapes
from cultivation which rival in their products the orchard-grown cherries.
It is from reverted seedlings that the description of the species herewith
given has been made. The number of cultivated varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
avium</i> listed in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> is 549.</p>

<p>The habitat of the species and its history as a cultivated plant are
given in the following chapter. A further point of horticultural interest
as regards its habitat is that wherever found truly wild, as in its original
home in southern and central Europe and Asia Minor, it is to be found
in moderately dry, calcareous soils and seldom in the shade, preferring
always warm, sunny sites, as gravelly or stony hillsides. These predilections
cling to the species in its cultivated varieties. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>
differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> in an important horticultural character as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the two species grow spontaneously&mdash;the former suckers from the root
little or not at all, making it a suitable plant for a stock in orchard work,
while the latter suckers so much as to make it unfit for use as a stock.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> is variously divided by botanists and pomologists.
Whatever distinct forms of the species may exist in the wild state, they
are now interminably confused by hybridization under cultivation. It is
impossible to divide the species into botanical varieties from the characters
of the horticultural varieties, as many botanists have attempted to do.
The species can be roughly divided into two pomological groups, the
distinguishing character being the texture of the flesh.</p>

<p>Sweet Cherries with soft, tender flesh form one group known by
pomologists under the French group name Guigne or the English Gean.
These are also the Heart cherries of common parlance. These soft-fruited
cherries may again be divided into dark colored varieties with
reddish juice and light colored sorts with colorless juice. Typical light
colored Geans are Coe, Ida, Elton and Waterloo; dark colored ones are
Black Tartarian, Early Purple and Eagle. It is to this group of cherries
that Linnaeus gave the varietal name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juliana</i> and De Candolle the specific
name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus Juliana</i>.</p>

<p>The second group is distinguished by the firm, breaking flesh of the
fruits&mdash;the Bigarreaus of several languages, the name originally having
reference to the diverse colors of the fruits. This group is further divisible
in accordance with color of fruit and juice into black Bigarreaus and
light Bigarreaus. Chief of the black cherries falling into this division
are Windsor, Schmidt and Mezel; of the light ones, which are much more
numerous, Yellow Spanish and Napoleon are representative sorts. Linnaeus
called these hard-fleshed cherries <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium duracina</i>; De Candolle
called them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus duracina</i>; K. Koch, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium decumana</i>; and
Roemer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus bigarella</i>.</p>

<p>Besides these two orchard forms of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> several other horticultural
forms, quite as distinct or even more so, are grown as ornamentals,
some of which are listed as distinct species or as botanical varieties of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>. To add to the confusion, a number of Latinized garden
names are more or less commonly applied to these ornamental Sweet
Cherries. Schneider,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> in revising the genus Prunus, names four botanical
forms of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> and two natural hybrids with other species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<h3 lang="la" xml:lang="la">PRUNUS AVIUM &times; PRUNUS CERASUS</h3>

<p>The Duke cherries, long placed by most pomologists and botanists
in a botanical variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, are unquestionably hybrids between
the Sweet Cherry and the Sour Cherry. A study of the characters of
the varieties of the Duke cherries shows all gradations between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
cerasus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, though, in the main, they resemble the latter
more than the former, differing from the Sweet Cherries most noticeably
in having an acid flesh. Sterility is a common attribute of hybridism.
In this respect the Dukes behave like most hybrids. In several Duke
cherries all of the seeds collected at this Station are sterile; in others, most
of them are sterile and in none are the seeds as fertile as in varieties
known to be pure bred as to species. So, too, shrunken pollen grains
indicate hybridity. A study of the pollen of the Duke cherries shows
many grains, the greater proportion, to be abnormal, a condition not
found in the pollen of varieties true to species. May Duke, Reine Hortense
and Late Duke are the leading hybrid varieties.</p>

<p class="caption" lang="la" xml:lang="la">PRUNUS AVIUM &times; PRUNUS CERASUS (REINE HORTENSE)</p>
</div>

<p>There are dark colored Duke cherries with reddish juice and light
colored sorts with uncolored juice, just as in the two parent species. May
Duke is a typical variety with colored juice while Reine Hortense is
probably the best-known cherry among these hybrids with uncolored juice.
About 65 of the cherries listed in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> are "Dukes,"
or hybrids between the Sweet and the Sour Cherry.</p>

<p>The name Duke comes from the variety May Duke which is a corruption
of Médoc, a district in the department of Geronde, France, from
whence this variety came. The cherries of this group are known as Dukes
only in England; in France the name Royale is similarly used.</p>

<p>These hybrid cherries have been placed in a distinct botanical group
by several botanists. They constitute the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus regalis</i> Poiteau and
Turpin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Traite des Arb. Fruit</i>. 123); the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus bigarella regalis</i> Roemer

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i> is now a wild inhabitant of all southern Europe as
far north as central France, southern Germany, Austria-Hungary and
eastward through Asia Minor and Caucasia to and within the borders
of Turkestan. Wherever it grows spontaneously in the Old World it is
said to prefer rocky, gravelly, sunny slopes and the climate in which the
grape thrives best. Wild or cultivated, the Mahaleb is a shallow-rooted
plant, a fact that must be taken into consideration in its use as a stock.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i> is a common escape from cultivation in eastern North
America especially about the nursery centers of central New York.</p>

<p>The Mahaleb, or St. Lucie cherry, is of no importance to fruit-growers
for its fruit but as a consort with nearly all of the Sweet and Sour
Cherries now being propagated in North America it becomes of prime
importance and so receives botanical consideration here. According to
Schneider, in the reference cited, there are several spontaneous forms of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i> and also several horticultural varieties grown as ornamentals.
None of these, wild or cultivated, are of interest to fruit-growers,
unless, perchance some one of them should prove to be a better
stock upon which to work orchard cherries. Mahaleb stocks are usually
grown as seedlings but may also be propagated from root cuttings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>The wood of the Mahaleb tree is of value in cabinet making, possessing
among other good qualities a pleasant and lasting odor. The leaves,
too, are odoriferous and are more or less used in France in the manufacture
of perfumes and in cookery to give savor to sauces.</p>

<p>The habitat of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus tomentosa</i> is probably Central Asia though
it is now to be found growing spontaneously in East Tibet and the Chinese
provinces of Setschuan, Hupe, Kansu and perhaps Tochlii.</p>

<p>This shrub-like cherry is very generally cultivated in central, eastern
and northern China and in Japan for its fruit and as an ornamental. It
has been introduced into cultivation in many widely separated places in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
North America and appears to be promising for cold regions, both bud
and wood withstanding perfectly the most rigorous climates of the United
States. As it grows in America it is a bush and never a true tree. It is
a twiggy, close-jointed plant, usually with many stems springing from
the ground and these bearing branches quite to the base. Frequently
these low-growing branches bend to the ground and take root forming
new plants. The bushes are thickly clothed with leaves densely tomentose
on the underside, in this respect and in shape, as well, very unlike the
foliage of common cultivated cherries. The flowers appear in great abundance
with the leaves, making a handsome ornamental; they are white,
becoming rose-colored as they fall away. The fruit ripens in mid-season
for cherries, setting profusely from the many blossoms. The cherries
are a half-inch in diameter, bright currant-red, covered with inconspicuous
hairs and contain a stone of medium size. They are pleasantly acid,
very juicy and withal a decided addition to cultivated cherries. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
tomentosa</i> seems a most promising plant for domestication and of particular
merit for small gardens and cold regions.</p>

<p>Koehne, in his list of cherries, names ten botanical varieties of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus tomentosa</i>. From this the species seems to be most variable and
under cultivation would probably break up into many forms some of which
might prove superior to the type species. Koehne's botanical varieties
are given under the species on page 22.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pumila</i>, the Sand Cherry, or Dwarf Cherry, of eastern America,
is found on sandy and rocky inland shores from Maine to the District of
Columbia and northwestward to the Lake of the Woods in Canada. In
particular it is common on the sand dunes of the Great Lakes. Everywhere
in the wild state it grows in light sands suggesting its use in arid
soils and especially on poor soils in cold climates.</p>

<p>As yet there seem to be no named varieties of this cherry known to
fruit-growers, its nearly related species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus besseyi</i>, offering greater
opportunities to both the fruit-grower and the experimenter. Both the
plants and fruits are so variable, the size, color and quality of the crop
on some plants being quite attractive, that it is certain an opportunity
to domesticate a worthy native plant is being overlooked. The species
ought to have value, too, as a stock on which to work other cherries for
sandy soils, dwarf trees and exacting climates.</p>

<p>The plant is dwarfer but is more erect never having prostrate branches;
the branches are smoother and lighter colored; the leaves are shorter, more
oval, more obtuse, thinner, less conspicuously veined, teeth fewer and
the points more appressed; the flowers are larger, petals broader and are
borne on slightly curled stems in umbels of two to four; the fruit and
stone in the two species are much the same, possibly averaging smaller
in this species.</p>

<p>The habitat of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus besseyi</i> is not yet definitely bounded but it
can, at least, be said that this species is to be found on the prairies from
Manitoba and Minnesota to southern Kansas and westward into Montana,
Wyoming and Utah. In its natural range it undoubtedly runs into that
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pumila</i> to the east, and Waugh, in the reference given, holds
that the two species grade into each other and he, therefore, makes this
a variety of the eastern species. Certainly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pumila</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
besseyi</i> are as distinct as are many other of the more or less indefinite
species of this genus&mdash;few, indeed, are the species of Prunus that do not
have outliers which overlap other types and, as we shall see, there are
hybrids between this and species of other cherries, plums and even peaches
and apricots, showing that the lines of demarcation between the members
of this genus are difficult to define.</p>

<p>Although <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus besseyi</i> has received attention from horticulturists
less than a quarter-century it has aroused much interest, best indicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
by the fact that now a considerable number of varieties of the species
are under cultivation and there are more than a score of hybrids disseminated
in which it is one of the parents. Indians, trappers and
early settlers have long used the wild fruit under the name of Western
Sand Cherry, Bessey's Cherry and Rocky Mountain Cherry. Among
pioneers this cherry was held in high esteem for sauces, pies and preserves
and, where there was a dearth of cultivated cherries, was eaten with relish
out of hand. The flesh is tender, juicy and, while astringent as commonly
found, plants bearing aromatic and very palatable cherries are often found
growing wild while some of the domesticated plants bear very well-flavored
fruits. All speak of the Sand Cherry as wonderful in productiveness
and as having remarkable capacity to withstand the vicissitudes of the
exacting climate in which it grows. A valuable asset of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus besseyi</i>
is its great variability. Fruit from different plants varies in size, color
and flavor suggesting that, under cultivation, amelioration will proceed
rapidly. The plants of this species root freely from layers or root-cuttings
and are therefore easily propagated and multiplied.</p>

<p>But it is in its hybrids that this western cherry has proved most
valuable in horticulture. There are now hybrids under cultivation
between this species and the Sand plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus augustifolia watsoni</i>),
the Hortulana plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus hortulana</i>), the Simonii plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus simonii</i>),
the Japanese plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus triflora</i>), the American plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus americana</i>),
the Cherry plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasifera</i>), the Sweet Cherry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
avium</i>), the peach (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus persica</i>), the apricots <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">(Prunus armeniaca</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mume</i>), and the common plum <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">(Prunus domestica</i>). It would
almost seem that this species is the "go-between" of the many and
varied types of the genus Prunus. It is true that few of these hybrids
yet shine as orchard plants but, given time, it seems certain that some
will prove valuable in general horticulture and that many will be grown
in the special horticulture of the northern Mississippi Valley and the adjoining
plains to the west. Credit must be given to Professor N. E. Hansen
of the South Dakota Experiment Station for most of our present knowledge
of hybridism between this and other species.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>In his work with this species Hansen has also found that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus besseyi</i>
makes a very good stock for peaches, apricots, Japanese and native plums
and that, while it does not so readily consort with the true cherries, yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
it can be used as a stock for them. On the other hand larger fruits of
the Sand Cherry can be grown when it is budded on stocks of the
Americana.</p>

<p>Besides these well-recognized species of cultivated cherries there are
several others that play a much less conspicuous part in horticulture.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus fruticosa</i> Pallas, the Dwarf Cherry of Europe, is much cultivated,
more especially its botanical variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendula</i>, as an ornamental and somewhat
for its fruit. According to Wilson,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus involucrata</i> Koehne is
grown for its fruit in the gardens of China; the fruits, he says, are "small
and lacking in flavour." The fruits of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus emarginata</i> Walpers are
eaten by the Indians on the Pacific Coast and the early settlers used the
species as a stock for orchard cherries. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus jacquemontii</i> Hooker,
the Dwarf Cherry of Afghanistan and Tibet, is occasionally in culture
for its fruit and as a park plant; so also is another dwarf cherry from
southwestern Asia, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus incana</i> Steven. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pseudocerasus</i> Lindley,
the Flowering Cherry of Japan, is a well-known ornamental the world
over and in Japan is used as a stock for orchard cherries for which purpose,
as we have suggested in the discussion of stocks, it ought to be tried in
America.</p>

THE HISTORY OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES</h2>

<h3>THE ANCIENT USE OF CHERRIES</h3>

<p>History casts no direct light upon the period when the cherry first
came under cultivation. Undoubtedly primitive men in all parts of the
North Temperate Zone enlivened their scanty fruit fare with wild cherries.
Cultivated cherries, we know, had their origin in the Old World. But
history tells us nothing of the period when Europe and Asia were unbroken
forests inhabitated by savages who eked out a precarious subsistence by
the pursuit of the chase and from meagre harvests of wild grains, fruits
and vegetables. On these continents agriculture and rude civilization
began in ages immemorial and cultivated plants diversified, enriched and
adorned the landscapes long before the first written records. Our knowledge
of how wild cherries have been remodeled into the orchard and garden
varieties of today&mdash;of what the methods and processes of domestication
have been&mdash;is, therefore, doubtful and limited, for the mind and hand
of man had been deeply impressed upon the cherry long before the faint
traditions which have been transmitted to our day could possibly have
arisen.</p>

<p>The history of the cherry, then, goes back to primitive man. Direct
proof of the ancient use of cherries is furnished by the finding of cherry-pits
of several species in the deposits of Swiss lake-dwellings, in the mounds
and cliff-caves of prehistoric inhabitants of America and in the ancient
rubbish-heaps of Scandinavian countries. There are but few regions in
which cultivated cherries are grown in which the inhabitants in times of
stress, or by choice in times of plenty, do not now use as food wild
cherries, some species of which grow in abundance and under the most
varied conditions, almost from the Arctic Circle to within a few degrees
of the Tropic of Cancer in a belt encircling the globe. It is probable that
all of the wild species which have furnished fruit to the aborigines or to
the modern inhabitants of a region have been sparingly cultivated&mdash;at
the very least if they possessed any considerable food value they have
been more or less widely distributed by the hand of man. But, curiously
enough, out of the score or more of species of which the fruit is used as
food as the plants grow wild, but two may be said to be truly domesticated.
These are the Sour, or Pie Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, and the Sweet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, with the histories of which we are now to be
concerned.</p>

<p>Pliny is generally accredited as the first historian of the cherry.
Nearly eighteen and a half centuries ago he gave an account of the cherries
of Rome with the statement that Lucullus, the Roman soldier and gourmet,
had brought them to Rome 65 years before Christ<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> from the region of
the Black Sea. This particular in the account proves to be a good illustration
of the adage that old errors strike root deeply. Though disproved
beyond all question of doubt time and time again by botanists and
historians, Pliny's inadvertence is still everywhere current in text-books,
pomologies and cyclopaedias&mdash;a mis-statement started, repeated and
perpetuated from medieval days when to be printed in Pliny was sufficient
proof. That Lucullus brought to Italy a cherry and one which the
Romans did not know there is no reason to doubt, but other cherries there
must have been, not only wild but cultivated, of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> at least
and probably of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, and in comparative abundance long before
Lucullus, returning from the war in Pontus with Mithridates, brought to
Rome a cherry. With this brief mention of Pliny's inaccuracy, we pass
to more substantial facts in the history of the cherry.</p>

<p>The domestication of one or the other of the two generally cultivated
species of cherries followed step by step the changes from savagery to
civilization in the countries of Europe and of western Asia. For, as one
sorts the accumulated stores of botanical and historical evidence, it becomes
quickly apparent that both the Sweet and the Sour Cherry now grow wild
and long have done so in the region named and that, from the time
tillage of plants was first practiced in the Old World, this fruit has been
under cultivation, feeble, obscure, and interrupted by war and chase
though its cultivation may have been. Certainly the history of the cherry
is as old as that of agriculture in the southern European countries and is
interwritten with it.</p>

<p>In beginning the history of a cultivated plant the first step is to
ascertain where it grows spontaneously&mdash;where it may be found unplanted
and unattended by man. This is the task now before us for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
cerasus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, discussing them in the order named.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES</h3>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, of which the Montmorency is the commonest representative
in America, is now to be found wild wherever Sour Cherries are
much grown, for it is a favorite food of many birds which quickly scatter
its seeds from centers of cultivation. Nearly all of the botanies of temperate
regions in which agriculture is carried on name this cherry as an
escape from cultivation into woods and hedgerows and along roadsides.
The Sour Cherry, then, is now to be found truly wild in many parts of
several continents. It is not so easy to say where the habitat and what
the condition before the species was cultivated. But botany, archaeology,
history and philology indicate that the original habitat of the Sour Cherry
is southeastern Europe and the nearby countries in Asia.</p>

<p>After saying that this cherry has been found wild in the forests of
Asia Minor, the plains of Macedonia, on Mount Olympus and in neighboring
territories, De Candolle, however, limits its habitat to the region
"from the Caspian Sea to the environments of Constantinople."<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> But
as a wild plant this cherry must have spread over a far greater area. Even
the broadest boundaries of the habitat of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> as set by
De Candolle show over-caution. Thus, the Marasca cherry, a botanical
variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, is most certainly wild in the Province of Dalmatia
on the Adriatic Sea in Austria; so, too, it is certain that this species is
feral as far away from De Candolle's center of distribution as northern
Austria and southern Germany and has been so for untold ages. It is safe
to say that the original source of the Sour Cherry was the territory lying
between Switzerland and the Adriatic Sea on the west and the Caspian
Sea and probably somewhat farther north on the east. That is, our
savage forefathers must have found this cherry in the region thus outlined,
probably in a much more extended territory, into which it was brought
in more or less remote times by agencies other than human from De
Candolle's smaller area of origin.</p>

<p>It is easier to define the geographic range of the wild Sweet Cherry.
Botanists very generally agree that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> as a wild plant inhabits
all of the mainland of Europe in which the cultivated varieties of the
species can be grown&mdash;that is, most of the continent south of Sweden,
and may be found wild well into southern Russia. The species is reported
sparingly wild in northern Africa and is a very common wild plant in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
southern Asia as far east as northern India. It must not be thought that
the plant is everywhere abundant in the great area outlined as its habitat.
To the contrary, the Sweet Cherry is an uncommon wild plant in Spain,
Italy and other parts of southern Europe. All authorities agree that the
region of greatest communal intensity for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> is between the
Caspian and Black Seas and south of these bodies of water. It might
suffice to say that from about these seas the Sweet Cherry came&mdash;that
here grew the trunk from which branches were spread into other lands
by birds and animals carrying the seeds from place to place. The most
important fact to be established, however, is that this cherry has long
grown spontaneously over a widely extended territory and may, therefore,
have been domesticated in several widely separated regions.</p>

<h3>THE CHERRY IN GREECE; THE FIRST RECORD OF CULTURE AND THE NAME</h3>

<p>Having established the habitats of the two cultivated cherries we
may next ask when and where their cultivation began. The domestication
of plants probably began in China&mdash;certainly Chinese agriculture
long antedates that of any other nation now in existence of which we have
records. Agriculture in China, historians roughly approximate, goes back
4,000 years. But while the Chinese have many other species of cherry,
as we have seen, some of which may be said to be partially domesticated,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> are not found wild in China and were
only in recent years introduced there as cultivated plants. Neither does
the cherry of our civilization seem to have been known in the second
great agricultural region of the world&mdash;Egypt and the extreme southwest
of Asia. At least there are no words for the cherry in the languages
of the peoples of that region and cherry pits have not been found with
the remains of other plants in the tombs and ruins of Egypt, Assyria and
Babylon. Nor does the cherry seem to have been cultivated in India
until comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>These very brief and general statements show that cherries were
not cultivated in the first agricultural civilizations and serve to fix the
time and the place of the domestication of the cherry a little more
definitely. Records of cherries as cultivated plants begin, so far as the
researches of botanical historians now show, with Greek civilization though
it is probable, for several reasons, that some cultivated cherries came to
Greece from Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Theophrastus, to whom Linnaeus gave the title "Father of Botany,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
writing about 300 years before the Christian era in his <cite>History of Plants</cite>,
is, according to botanical historians, the first of the Greek writers to
mention the cherry. His statement is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The cherry is a peculiar tree, of large size, some attaining the height
of twenty-four cubits, rather thick, so that they may measure two cubits
in circumference at the base. The leaf is like that of the mespilus, rather
firm and broader, the color of the foliage such that the tree may be
distinguished from others at a good distance. The bark, by its color,
smoothness and thickness, is like that of tilia. The flower [meaning, the
cluster of flowers] is white, resembling that of the pear and mespilus, consisting
of small [separate] flowers. The fruit is red, similar to that of
diospyros [but what his diospyros was no one knows] of the size of a
faba [perhaps nelumbo seed], which is hard, but the cherry is soft. The
tree grows in the same situations as tilia; by streams."<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>From this passage we gather that the cherry Theophrastus knew was
the Sweet Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>; the description shows it to be the same
large, tall tree now naturalized in open woods and along roadsides in
many parts of the United States. From the fact that Theophrastus
describes the tree and the bark in more detail than the fruit we may
assume that the cherry was more esteemed in ancient Greece as a timber-tree
than as a fruit-tree. Curiously enough the name the Greeks at this
time used for the Sweet Cherry is now applied to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, the Sour
Cherry.</p>

<p>"Kerasos" was the Sweet Cherry in ancient Greece and from kerasos
came <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerasus</i>, used by many botanists as the name of the genus. That
the Sweet Cherry should by the use of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">avium</i> be denominated the "bird
cherry" is clear since birds show much discrimination between cherries,
but why the Sour Cherry should be given the specific name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerasus</i>, first
applied to the Sweet Cherry, is not apparent.</p>

<p>Pages are written in the old pomologies and botanical histories as
to the origin of the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerasus</i>. Pliny's statement that Lucullus called
the cherry <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerasus</i> from the town from which he obtained it, Kerasun in
Pontus, on the Black Sea, is, in the light of all who have since looked into
the matter, a misconception. To the contrary, commentators now agree
that the town received its name from the cherry which grows most abundantly
in the forests in that part of Asia Minor. The name, according
to all authorities, is very ancient&mdash;a linguistic proof of the antiquity of
the cherry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>To sum up, the cherry comes into literature first from Greece in the
writings of Theophrastus. There can be but little doubt, however, but
that it had been cultivated for centuries before Theophrastus wrote.
Whether one or both of the two cherries were domesticated by the
Greeks, beginning with their civilization, or whether cultivated cherries
came to Greece from Asia Minor, is not now known. It is very probable
that some of the several varieties grown in Greece came under cultivation
through domestication of wild plants; others were introduced from regions
farther east.</p>

<h3>THE SWEET CHERRY POSSIBLY THE PARENT OF THE SOUR CHERRY</h3>

<p>A digression may be permitted here to state a hypothesis suggested
by De Candolle<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> which should interest both fruit-growers and plant-breeders.
De Candolle, while considering the two species of cultivated
cherries to be now quite distinct, suggests that, since they differ essentially
but little in their characters and since their original habitats were in the
same region, it is probable that one species came from the other. He
surmises, since <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> is the commoner in the original home,
is generally the more vigorous of the two, has spread much farther and
probably at a much earlier date from the primal habitation in Asia Minor
than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, that the latter, the Sour Cherry, is derived from
the Sweet Cherry. In the future breeding of cherries confirmatory evidence
of such a relationship may be obtained though, should none be found,
the negation should go for naught and the supposition can only remain
an interesting and plausible hypothesis.</p>

<h3>THE CHERRY IN ITALY</h3>

<p>Pliny attempts to give the first full account of cultivated cherries
and, even though among his statements are several inaccuracies, yet he
may be said to have made a very good beginning of a flora of cultivated
cherries for he names and describes ten varieties. The fact that there
were as many as ten cherries in Italy at the time Pliny wrote, less than
a century after the return of Lucullus from Pontus, is strong evidence
that the cherry in Italy antedates Lucullus. Besides, it is hardly probable
that Pliny knew and described all of the cherries to be found in the whole
of his country. But even if these ten comprise the entire number, those
who know how extremely difficult it is to introduce new plants in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a country with the facilities we have in our day, will doubt that all of the
cherries in Pliny's account could have been introduced in Italy 1900
years ago and have come under general cultivation, as according to Pliny
they had, within the short space of a century. The following quotation,
then, must be taken as an account of the cherries grown in Italy in the
first century after Christ with little weight given to the historical evidence
presented.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>"The cherry did not exist in Italy before the period of the victory
gained over Mithridates by L. Lucullus, in the year of the City 680. He
was the first to introduce this tree from Pontus, and now, in the course
of one hundred and twenty years, it has travelled beyond the Ocean, and
arrived in Britannia even. The cherry, as we have already stated, in
spite of every care, has been found impossible to rear in Egypt. Of
this fruit, that known as the "Apronian" is the reddest variety, the
Lutatian being the blackest, and the Caecilian perfectly round. The
Junian cherry has an agreeable flavour, but only, so to say, when eaten
beneath the tree, as they are so remarkably delicate that they will not
bear carrying. The highest rank, however, has been awarded to the
Duracinus variety, known in Campania as the "Plinian" cherry, and
in Belgica to the Lusitanian cherry, as also to one that grows on the banks
of the Rhenus. This last kind has a third colour, being a mixture of
black, red, and green, and has always the appearance of being just on
the turn to ripening. It is less than five years since the kind known as
the "laurel-cherry" was introduced, of a bitter but not unpleasant flavour,
the produce of a graft upon the laurel. The Macedonian cherry grows
on a tree that is very small, and rarely exceeds three cubits in height;
while the chamaecerasus is still smaller, being but a mere shrub. The
cherry is one of the first trees to recompense the cultivator with its
yearly growth; it loves cold localities and a site exposed to the north.
The fruits are sometimes dried in the sun, and preserved, like olives, in
casks."</p>

<p>How are the cherries described in the passage from Pliny related
to those of modern culture? A score or more of commentators have tried
to tell but when the comments are compared Pliny's disorder becomes
confusion worse confounded. Here, as in his historical statements, Pliny
seems to have prepared the ground for a fine crop of misunderstandings.
The speculations as to what particular cherry each of the descriptions
fits quickly show the futility of specification. A few generalizations only
are warranted.</p>

<p>Thus, if we assume, as most commentators do, that Apronian, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
first of Pliny's varieties, was named after Apronius, a Roman praetor of
Pliny's day, there is nothing to indicate the character of the cherry except
the word "reddest" which means but little for it is no more possible to
distinguish cherries by redness than by its blackness to tell a pot from
a kettle.</p>

<p>It is as impossible to distinguish the second variety as the first. The
name given is Lutatian, the variety having been dedicated, as all commentators
agree, to Lutatius Catulus, a contemporary of Lucullus, revered
by Romans for having rebuilt the capitol after it had been destroyed by
fire. It is described as "being the blackest" but whether <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, sweet or sour, who can tell?</p>

<p>The third variety is called the Caecilian cherry, which we are told
is "perfectly round"&mdash;a character possessed in like degree by many
cherries. The name, on the authority of Latin scholars, commemorates
the Caecilius family, rich and powerful Romans, friends of Lucullus at
the time he was promoting cherry culture.</p>

<p>We may be a little more certain of the identity of the fourth cherry,
called the Junian, and said to have been possessed of "an agreeable flavor
but only, so to say, when eaten beneath the tree, as they are so remarkably
delicate that they will not bear carrying." Whether the name was
given in honor of the Roman Republican, Junius Brutus, who died 42
A. D. or from Junius, the month of their ripening, cannot be said. The
description, as practically all agree, fits very well the French Guigne or
English Gean group of cherries. It is probable that "Guigne" is a perversion
of "Junian."</p>

<p>There can be little question as to the cherry Pliny next describes,
"the Duracinus variety" which he says has been awarded "highest
rank" and to which he paid the compliment of giving it his own name,
for he tells us that it is "known in Campania as the Plinian cherry."
This hard-fleshed cherry of delectable quality can be no other than
a Bigarreau&mdash;some protean Napoleon, Yellow Spanish, Windsor or the
older Oxheart and Elkhorn.</p>

<p>The sixth cherry is the Lusitanian, which, if the translations read
aright, the Belgians rank highest. Ancient Lusitania is modern Portugal
and the Lusitanian cherry may be the Griotte of Portugal grown from
time immemorial in that country. The identity of the variety is not
so important in this passage as is the connection that Pliny establishes
in cherry culture at this early time between Portugal, Italy and Belgium.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
By such tokens does our author cast doubt upon his statement that
Lucullus had but yesterday, as it were, brought the cherry from Pontus.</p>

<p>The seventh cherry is one "that grows on the banks of the Rhenus"
(Rhine), further described as "being a mixture of black, red and green,"
and of having "always the appearance of being just on the turn to ripening."
It is useless to add another guess to those of the many commentators
as to what this tri-colored cherry from the banks of the Rhine may be.</p>

<p>The eighth description, that of the "laurel-cherry," applies to a graft
and not to a variety. Of it, Pliny says, "It is less than five years since
the kind known as the laurel-cherry was introduced, of a bitter, but not
unpleasant flavor, the produce of a graft upon the laurel." It is barely
possible that a cherry could be made to grow on a laurel five years but it is
extremely doubtful, as all modern horticulturists who have tried it say, and
it is impossible to have such a graft bear fruit. Pliny was misinformed.</p>

<p>The ninth and tenth of Pliny's cherries, the Macedonian and the
Chamaecerasus, are probably one and the same, since but one cherry
that could possibly answer to the descriptions given could have been in
Italy at the time Pliny wrote. The cherry described, then, was almost
beyond doubt <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus fruticosa</i> Pallas, a synonym of which is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
chamaecerasus</i> Jacquin, perpetuating the name used by Pliny. This is
the European Dwarf Cherry, or Ground Cherry, which is now and was
probably then a wild plant in parts of Italy and which is very well
described by "a tree that is very small, and rarely exceeds three cubits
in height."</p>

<p>We have accredited Pliny with having first described cherries in Italy
and discredited his account of their introduction in his own country, but
chiefly on inferential evidence. Just a few words of direct proof that
the cherry was long in cultivation by the Romans before Lucullus and
we have done with the introduction of the cherry into Italy and have
filled another gap between Theophrastus and our own times. Marcus
Terentius Varro (B. C. 117-27), one of the illustrious scholars of ancient
Rome, sometimes called the father of Roman learning, in his eightieth
year, as he tells us in his first chapter, wrote a book on farming&mdash;one,
which, by the way, may be read with profit by modern farmers.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In book
1, chapter XXXIX, he tells when to graft cherries, discussing the process
not as if it or the cherry were new or little known but as if the cherry were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
as commonplace as the other agricultural crops of the times. Varro
effectually disproves Pliny to whose mis-statement we have given so much
space only because for nearly 2000 years it has been generally accepted as
the truth.</p>

<p>The gaps in the history of the cherry are long. Athenaeus,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Tertullian,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Ammianus,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and St. Jerome,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Roman writers of the Third and
Fourth Centuries, mention cherries but chiefly to repeat and perpetuate
Pliny's errors. It was not until the Sixteenth Century&mdash;a lapse of
1400 years&mdash;that an attempt was again made to describe in full cultivated
cherries. Sometime in this century, Matthiolus (1487-1577), a Tuscan and
one of the eminent naturalists not only of Italy but of the world in the
Middle Ages, in translating and annotating the medical works of the Greek
writer Dioscorides, made a list of the fruit-trees then grown in Italy. As
the second descriptive list of cherries this contribution of Matthiolus
might be worth reprinting were it not, as in Pliny, that but few of his
varieties can be certainly made out. He does, however, make a number
of additions to Pliny's list but space does not permit a consideration of
these; especially since Gerarde, writing less than a century later in English,
so well amplifies Matthiolus that we shall print his account.</p>

<h3>CHERRIES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>Pliny mentions the cherry as growing in several countries and, by
reading between lines, we may assume that cultivated cherries were distributed
throughout all parts of Europe where agriculture was practiced,
by Christ's time or shortly thereafter. Pliny speaks of the cherry in
some connection with England, Germany, Belgium and Portugal. Surely
we may assume that the cherry was being grown at the same time in at
least the countries in Europe which are between or border on those named.
But from Pliny to the Sixteenth Century the current of progress in cherry
culture was immeasurably slow. In the intervening 1600 years not a score
of new cherries were brought under cultivation. Attention was probably
given during these dark ages to this and to all fruits as species and as
divisions of species which came nearly or quite true to seed. It was only
in the refinements of horticulture and botany brought about by the herbalists
that true horticultural varieties came into common cultivation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>Thus, the first of the German herbals, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Herbarius</i>, printed at
Mainz in 1491, does not describe or even name varieties of cherries but
groups them in the two species as Sweets and Sours, the statement running:<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
"The cherries are some sweet, some sour, like the wild apple;
the sours bring to the stomach gas and make the mouth fresh (frisch),
those too sweet or too sour are of little use." A wood-cut in this old herbal
illustrates a Sour Cherry.</p>

<p>According to Müller,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> not until 1569 did the Germans attempt to
give names to varieties, when, in a medical herbal, the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gart der Gesundheit</i>,
cherries were roughly divided into four groups: (1) The Amarellen, sour,
dark red cherries with long stems. (2) The Weichselkirschen, red cherries
with white juice and short stems. (3) The Süsskirschen, red or black
Sweet Cherries with long stems. (4) "Beside these yet more" distinguished
by their shape and the province in which they are grown. Not until well
into the Eighteenth Century do the Germans seem to have given names
to more than a few of the most distinct varieties of cherries. Yet the
cherry was more largely cultivated in Germany, one, two, or three centuries
ago, as it is now, than in any other European country. This, one readily
gleans from what has been written on cherries in different countries and
from the acknowledgments of foreign pomologists to those of Germany
for most of what has been printed regarding cherries. Not only has the
cherry been a favorite orchard plant in Germany but since the Sixteenth
Century it has been largely planted along the public roads.</p>

<p>Of cherries on the continent, for this brief history, nothing more
need be said. Most of the varieties that have been imported from Europe
to America have come from England and we must, therefore, devote rather
more attention to the history of the cherry in England than in other
European countries.</p>

<h3>CHERRIES IN ENGLAND</h3>

<p>Cultivated cherries came to England with the Romans. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
avium</i> is indigenous in Great Britain but probably no care worthy the
name cultivation was given these wild trees by the ancient Britons. Pliny
states that the cherry was carried from Rome to Britain before the middle
of the First Century&mdash;meaning probably some improved variety. In no
part of the world does the cherry take more kindly to the soil than in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
England and no doubt this fruit became firmly established in Kent, where
the Romans settled, before the downfall of the southern invaders. With
the expulsion of the Romans and the subsequent influx of barbarians,
agriculture, especially gardening and fruit-growing, became almost a lost
art but still it is not probable that the cherry was wholly lost to cultivation
during the Teutonic invasions of Britain.</p>

<p>Fruit-growing could not have greatly prospered, however, in the
centuries of strife with the barbarians which succeeded Roman rule in
England; and a revival of cherry culture did not take place until the reintroduction
of Christianity and the establishment of monasteries where,
undisturbed by wars, the monks became notable horticulturists. They
not only had opportunity in the comparative peace in which their lives
were cast to grow fruit but many of them were men of superior intelligence
and skill and from intercourse with the continental countries learned what
plants were worth growing and how to grow them&mdash;the monasteries
were the experiment stations of the times. Undoubtedly the monks in
bringing to England treasures from the continent did not forget fruits
and among them cherries.</p>

<p>Passing by a considerable number of references which could be cited
to show that cherries of one kind and another were cultivated in Britain
from at least as early a date as the Ninth Century, we come to the discussion
of this fruit by the herbalists of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries. Of the three great English herbalists, Turner published his
work in 1538; Gerarde's, printed in 1596, was revised and greatly improved
by Johnson in 1633; Parkinson's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris</i>, or
Park-in-Suns Earthly Paradise&mdash;the author evidently a punster&mdash;was
published in 1629. All of these contain as full botanical and pomological
discussions of cherries as knowledge then permitted.</p>

<p>It must not be thought, by those unacquainted with the plant-lore
of the times, that the cherry received consideration only from the pens
of Turner, Gerarde, and Parkinson. During the time covered by the
lives of these three men a score or more of books were written in English
on botany and pomology in which accounts were given of the cherry, all
showing the esteem in which this fruit was held in England during and
before the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Space permits comments on the
account of the cherry given by but one of these Elizabethan herbalists,
and of the several Gerarde's seems best suited to our purpose.</p>

<p>We have chosen Gerarde because he treats the cherry more fully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
than do the other writers of the period and because he was a compiler
and a translator, having, as he quaintly says, "perused divers Herbals
set fourth in other languages;" thus from Gerarde we obtain a conception
of cherries growing on the continent as well as those growing in England.
Students of the English herbals say that Gerarde translated, copied and
adapted from Matthiolus, whose book we have noted, but more particularly
from Dodoens who in 1554 published in Antwerp <cite>A History of Plants</cite>.
These two worthies, in turn, had borrowed very freely from still more
ancient writers&mdash;Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Columella and others. As
might be suspected, errors centuries old were passed down, yet each new
translation or compilation contains much added information and is far
freer from error. In particular, Gerarde seems to have been a wise compiler
and adapter and to have combined a large measure of first-hand
practical knowledge with his borrowings from others. This is especially
true of what he writes concerning cherries, a fruit with which he seems
to have been very familiar.</p>

<p>The following is Gerarde's account, with interpolations by the
author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The ancient Herbalists have set down four kinds of Cherry trees;
the first is great and wild, the second tame or of the garden, the third
hath sour fruit, the fourth is that which is called in Latin Chamaecerasus,
or the dwarfe Cherry tree. The later writers have found divers sorts
more, some bringing forth great fruit, others lesser; some with white fruit,
some with blacke, others of the colour of black bloud, varying infinitely
according to the clymat and country where they grow."</p></blockquote>

<p>The four cherries which Gerarde says the "ancient herbalists have
set down" are, it is easy to see: first, the wild <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>; second,
cultivated sweet varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>; third, the sour <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>;
fourth, the Dwarf Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus fruticosa</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The English Cherry tree groweth to a high and great tree, the
body whereof is of a mean bignesse, which is parted above into very many
boughes, with a barke somewhat smooth, of a brown crimson colour, tough
and pliable; the substance or timber is also brown in the middle, and the
outer part is somewhat white: the leaves be great, broad, long, set with
veins or nerves, and sleightly nicked about the edges: the floures are white,
of a mean bigness, consisting of five leaves, and having certain threds
in the middle of the like colour. The Cherries be round, hanging upon
long stems or footstalks, with a stone in the middest which is covered
with a pulp or soft meat; the kernell thereof is not unpleasant to the
taste, though somewhat bitter."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>This is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, which is very generally wild in Britain&mdash;the
Gean of the English.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Flanders Cherry tree differeth not from our English Cherry
tree in Stature or form of leaves or floures, the only difference is, that
this tree brings forth his fruit sooner and greater than the other, wherefore
it may be called in Latine, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerasus praecox, sive Belgica</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>A cherry which "brings forth his fruit sooner and greater than
the other" can be no other than one of the early varieties of the Sweet
Cherry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Spanish Cherry tree groweth up to the height of our common
Cherry tree, the wood or timber is soft and loose, covered with a whitish
scaly barke, the branches are knotty, greater and fuller of substance than
any other Cherry tree; the leaves are likewise greater and longer than
any of the rest, in shape like those of the Chestnut tree: the floures are
like the others in form, but whiter of colour; the fruit is greater and longer
than any, white for the most part all over, except those that stand in
the hottest place where the sun hath some reflexion against a wall: they
are also white within, and of a pleasant taste."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have in this description a very good pen picture of Yellow
Spanish, one of the Bigarreaus, of which there must have been several in
common cultivation in Gerarde's time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Gascoin Cherry tree groweth very like to the Spanish Cherry
tree in stature, flours and leaves: it differeth in that it bringeth forth very
great Cherries, long, sharp pointed, with a certain hollownesse upon one
side, and spotted here and there with certain prickles of purple color as
smal as sand. The taste is most pleasant, and excelleth in beauty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Gascoin, sometimes "Gaskin" in England, is a corruption of Gascoigne,
a name applied by the French to cherries produced in Gascony
and said to have been brought to England by Joan of Kent when her husband,
the Black Prince, was commanding in Guienne and Gascony. The
variety is a very good Sweet Cherry, no doubt the one described in this
text under the name Bleeding Heart.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The late ripe Cherry tree groweth up like unto our wild English
Cherry tree, with the like leaves, branches and floures, saving that they
are sometimes once doubled; the fruit is small, round, and of a darke bloudy
colour when they be ripe, which the Frenchmen gather with their stalkes,
and hang them up in their houses in bunches or handfulls against Winter,
which the Physitions do give unto their patients in hot and burning fevers,
being first steeped in a little warme water, that causeth them to swell and
plumpe as full and fresh as when they did grow upon the tree.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>"The Cluster Cherry tree differeth not from the last described either
in leaves, branches, or stature: the floures are also like, but never commeth
any one of them to be double. The fruit is round, red when they be ripe,
and many growing upon one stem or foot-stalke in clusters, like as the
Grapes do. The taste is not unpleasant although somewhat soure."</p></blockquote>

<p>These two cherries, one sees at once, are varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>.
The first, Gerarde identifies for us on a succeeding page as the Morello.
He says of it: "The late ripe cherries which the Frenchmen keepe dried
against the winter, and are by them called Morelle, and wee after the
same name call them Morell Cherries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Cherrie-tree with double floures growes up unto a small tree,
not unlike to the common Cherrie-tree in each respect, saving that the
floures are somewhat double, that is to say, three or foure times double;
after which commeth fruit (though in small quantitie) like the other common
Cherry.</p>

<p>"The double floured Cherry-tree growes up like unto an hedge bush,
but not so great nor high as any of the others, the leaves and branches
differ not from the rest of the Cherry-tree. The floures hereof are exceeding
double, as are the flours of Marigolds, but of a white colour, and
smelling somewhat like the Hawthorne floures; after which come seldome
or never any fruit, although some Authors have said that it beareth sometimes
fruit, which my selfe have not at any time seen; notwithstanding
the tree hath growne in my Garden many yeeres, and that in an excellent
good place by a bricke wall, where it hath the reflection of the South Sunne,
fit for a tree that is not willing to beare fruit in our cold climat."</p></blockquote>

<p>These two are double-flowered cherries, several of which seem to
have been grown as ornamentals. Both belong to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> and
as we gather rather better elsewhere than here, both are of the Amarelle
type of tree.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Birds Cherry-tree, or the blacke Cherry-tree, that bringeth
forth very much fruit upon one branch (which better may be understood
by sight of the figure, than by words) springeth up like an Hedge tree
of small stature, it groweth in the wilde woods of Kent, and are there used
for stockes to graft other Cherries upon, of better tast, and more profit,
as especially those called the Flanders Cherries: this wilde tree growes
very plentifully in the North of England, especially at a place called
Heggdale, neere unto Rosgill in Westmerland, and in divers other places
about Crosbie Ravenswaith, and there called Hegberrie-tree: it groweth
likewise in Martome Parke, foure miles from Blackeburne, and in Harward
neere thereunto; in Lancashire almost in every hedge; the leaves and
branches differ not from those of the wilde Cherry-tree: the floures grow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
alongst the small branches, consisting of five small white leaves, with some
greenish and yellow thrums in the middle: after which come the fruit,
greene at the first, blacke when they be ripe, and of the bignesse of Sloes;
of an harsh and unpleasant taste.</p>

<p>"The other birds Cherry-tree differeth not from the former in any
respect, but in the colour of the berries; for as they are blacke; so on the
contrary, these are red when they be ripe, wherein they differ."</p></blockquote>

<p>The cherries described in these two paragraphs, one black and one
red, "that bringeth forth very much fruit upon one branch" and
"groweth in the wilde woods" and "of an harsh and unpleasant taste"
are of course the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus padus</i> of Britain and most of Europe&mdash;not
a true cherry but the racemose Bird Cherry, or Choke Cherry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The common blacke Cherry-tree growes up in some places to great
stature: there is no difference between it and our common Cherry-tree,
saving that the fruit hereof is very little in respect of other Cherries, and
of a blacke colour."</p></blockquote>

<p>This must be some wild Gean or Mazzard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The dwarfe Cherry-tree groweth very seldome to the height of
three cubits: the trunke or body small, covered with a darke coloured
blacke: whereupon do grow very limber and pliant twiggie branches: the
leaves are very small, not much unlike to those of the Privite bush: the
floures are small and white: after which come Cherries of a deepe red
colour when they be ripe, of taste somewhat sharpe, but not greatly
unpleasant: the branches laid downe in the earth, quickely take root,
whereby it is greatly increased."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus fruticosa</i> very well described.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My selfe with divers others have sundry other sorts in our gardens,
one called the Hart Cherry, the greater and the lesser; one of the great
bignesse, and most pleasant in taste, which we call <cite>Luke Wardes</cite> Cherry,
because he was the first that brought the same out of Italy; another we
have called the Naples Cherry, because it was first brought into these
parts from Naples: the fruit is very great, sharpe pointed, somewhat like
a man's heart in shape, of a pleasant taste, and of a deepe blackish colour
when it is ripe, as it were of the colour of dried bloud."</p></blockquote>

<p>Gerarde's Hart is probably one of the Heart cherries, while "Luke
Wardes Cherry" is one of the oldest named Sweet Cherries known in
England, having been mentioned by Parkinson and other of the herbalists
as well as in this list.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have another that bringeth forth Cherries also very great,
bigger than any Flanders Cherrie, of the colour of Jet, or burnished horn,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and of a most pleasant taste, as witnesseth Mr. Bull, the Queenes Majesties
Clockmaker, who did taste of the fruit (the tree bearing onely one cherry,
which he did eat; but my selfe never tasted of it) at the impression hereof.
We have also another, called the Agriot Cherry, of a reasonable good
taste. Another we have with fruit of a dun colour, tending to a watchet.
We have one of the Dwarfe Cherries, that bringeth forth fruit as great
as most of our Flanders Cherries, whereas the common sort hath very
small Cherries, and those of an harsh taste. These and many sorts more
we have in our London gardens, whereof to write particularly would greatly
enlarge our volume, and to small purpose: therefore, what hath beene
said shall suffice. I must here (as I have formerly done, in Peares, Apples,
and other such fruites) refer you to my two friends, Mr. <cite>John Parkinson</cite>,
and Mr. <cite>John Millen</cite>, the one to furnish you with the history, and the
other with the things themselves, if you desire them."</p></blockquote>

<p>One can only roughly surmise as to what the cherries mentioned in
this paragraph are with the exception of the Agriot which is, if the
synonymy of several European pomologists be correct, the Griotte Commune,
a sort supposed to have been brought from Syria by the crusaders
and to have been recorded under the last name in France as early as
1485.</p>

<p>The end of the Seventeenth Century saw a great revival of agriculture
in all of its branches on the continent; in England the revival began with
the fall of the commonwealth. From this time the progress of cherry
culture has been so rapid and so great that it would be an endless task
to give even a cursory view of it&mdash;a task unnecessary, too, for succeeding
the herbalists a great number of botanies, pomologies and works on agriculture
were published to many of which reference is still easy. Moreover,
the histories of varieties in this text carry us back quite to the beginning
of the Eighteenth Century.</p>

<p>There now remains for the history of the cherry but to sketch its
introduction and culture in North America, an undertaking that can be
done briefly and to the point, for the data are abundant, recent and reliable.
Here, too, accounts of the origin of varieties and the development of the
cherry may be looked for in the chapters which comprise the main part
of the book.</p>

<h3>CHERRIES IN AMERICA</h3>

<p>The cherry was one of the first fruits planted in the fields cleared
and enriched by our hardy American ancestry. From Canada to Florida
the colonists, though of several nationalities and those from one nation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
often representing several quite distinct classes, were forced alike to turn
at once to the cultivation of the soil as a means of subsistence. And while
in all of the colonies the early settlers must have been busily engaged in
the cultivation of cereals for the staff of life, in the South in growing
cotton and tobacco for money and for purposes of barter, in the North
in harvesting forest and fish products for bartering; yet the historians
of the colonies notice so often and describe so fully and with such warmth
of feeling the vegetables, flowers and fruits in the orchards and gardens
of the New World that it is certain that the ground was tilled not only
as a means of subsistence but because the tillers loved the luxuries of the
land.</p>

<p>What fruit better adapted to the uses of colonists than the cherry?
It possesses in a high degree, especially the Sour Cherry, the power of
adaptation to new environment and thrives under a greater variety of
conditions than any other of our fruits unless it be the apple, which it
at least equals in this respect. The cherry is easily propagated; it comes
in bearing early and bears regularly; of all fruits it requires least care&mdash;gives
the greatest returns under neglect; and the product is delectable
and adapted to many purposes. We shall expect, then, in examining the
early records of fruit-growing in America to find the cherry one of the
first planted and one of the most widely disseminated of fruits.</p>

<h3>CHERRIES PLANTED BY THE FRENCH IN AMERICA</h3>

<p>While written records are lacking, the plantations of old trees and
the development of cherry culture indicate that the French early planted
cherries in Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island and in the
early settlements on the St. Lawrence River. The cherry is a favorite
fruit of the French and the venerable trees that survived on the sites of
their settlements when the English came into possession of Canada are
proof sufficient that the émigrés from Provence or Normandy, fruit districts
of France from which many French settlers came, brought with
them seeds of the cherry with those of other fruits. Peter Kalm in his
<cite>Travels into North America</cite> in 1771,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> records the very general culture of
all the hardy fruits in Canada and leaves the impression that such had
been the case from the first settlements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<h3>CHERRIES IN NEW ENGLAND</h3>

<p>The cherry came to New England with the first settlers. This we
are told in all the records of early New England in which the conditions
of the country are described and of it we have confirmatory proof in many
enormous cherry trees, Sweet and Sour, both about ancient habitations
and as escapes from cultivation in woods, fields and fence rows, all pointing
to the early cultivation of this fruit. The early records are very specific.
Thus, to quote a few out of an embarrassment of references: Francis
Higginson writing in 1629, after naming the several other fruits then under
cultivation in Massachusetts, notes that the Red Kentish is the only cherry
cultivated.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> In the same year, the 16th of March, 1629, a memorandum
of the Massachusetts Company shows that "Stones of all sorts of fruites,
as peaches, plums, filberts, cherries, pear, aple, quince kernells" were
to be sent to New England.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>These seeds, provided by the home company with forethought of
the need of orchards in the colony, evidently produced fruit trees sufficient
to supply both hunger and thirst; for John Josselyn, who made
voyages to New England in 1638, 1639 and 1663, writing of "New England's
Rarities Discovered," says:<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> "Our fruit Trees prosper abundantly,
Apple-trees, Pear-trees, Quince-trees, Cherry-trees, Plum-trees, Barberry-trees.
I have observed with admiration, that the Kernels sown or the
Succors planted produce as fair and good fruit, without grafting, as the
tree from whence they were taken: the Countrey is replenished with fair
and large Orchards. It was affirmed by one Mr. Woolcut (a magistrate
in Connecticut Colony) at the Captains Messe (of which I was) aboard
the Ship I came home in, that he made Five hundred Hogsheads of Syder
out of his own Orchard in one year. Syder is very plentiful in the Countrey,
ordinarily sold for ten shillings a Hogshead.</p>

<p>"The Quinces, Cherries, Damsons, set the Dames a work, Marmalad
and preserved Damsons are to be met with in every house. It was not
long before I left the Countrey that I made Cherry wine, and so may
others, for there are good store of them both red and black. Their fruit
trees are subject to two diseases, the Meazels, which is when they are
burned and scorched with the Sun, and lowsiness, when the woodpeckers
jab holes in their bark: the way to cure them when they are lowsie is to
bore a hole in the main root with an Augur, and pour in a quantity of
Brandie or Rhum, and then stop it up with a pin made of the same Tree."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>As early as 1641, a nursery had been started in Massachusetts and
was selling among other trees those of the cherry. Troublesome pests
had made their appearance, too, as may be seen from the following letter,
probably from the first American nurseryman. The letter is written
by George Fenwith of Saybrook, Connecticut, under date of May 6, 1641,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
to Governor John Winthrop, Jr.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I haue receaued the trees yow sent me, for which I hartily thanke
yow. If I had any thing heare that could pleasure yow, yow should frely
command it. I am prettie well storred with chirrie &amp; peach trees, &amp; did
hope I had had a good nurserie of aples, of the aples yow sent me last
yeare, but the wormes have in a manner distroyed them all as they came
vp. I pray informe me if yow know any way to preuent the like mischiefe
for the future."</p></blockquote>

<p>These early plantations of cherries in New England were undoubtedly
grown from seed; for buds, cions and trees could not have been imported
unless the latter were brought over potted out as was not commonly done
until a century and a half later&mdash;at least, the records make mention
of seeds and not of trees as was the case just before and after the
Revolutionary War. A statement left by one of the Chief Justices of
Massachusetts, Paul Dudley, living at Roxbury, at as late a date as 1726,
indicates that varieties were few. In a paper in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
on agricultural conditions in Massachusetts, among many other
interesting things, Justice Dudley says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our apples are without doubt as good as those of England, and
much fairer to look to, and so are the pears, but we have not got all the
sorts. Our peaches do rather excel those of England, and then we have
not the trouble or expence of walls for them; for our peach trees are all
standards, and I have had in my own garden seven or eight hundred fine
peaches of the Rare-ripes, growing at a time on one tree. Our people,
of late years, have run so much upon orchards, that in a village near Boston,
consisting of about forty families, they made near three thousand barrels
of cyder. This was in the year 1721. And in another town of two hundred
families, in the same year I am credibly informed they made near ten
thousand barrels. Our peach trees are large and fruitful, and bear commonly
in three years from the stone. Our common cherries are not so
good as the Kentish cherries of England, and we have no Dukes or Heart
cherries, unless in two or three gardens."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<h3>CHERRIES IN NEW YORK</h3>

<p>Though settled at about the same time and having a more congenial
climate, New York made progress in fruit-growing more slowly than
Massachusetts. The early Dutch settlers in New York were transient
traders and not home makers. Actual settlement with homes in view
did not begin until after the historical bargain in which thrifty Peter
Minuit had acquired Manhattan Island for $24.00 and the country became
New Amsterdam. But troublesome times followed under the rule of
Minuit, Wouter Van Twiller and Kieft, quarrels and actual war, or the
fear of it, with colonists to the north and south as well as with the savages,
preventing the planting of orchards and farms until in 1647 when the
reins of government were taken in hand by Peter Stuyvesant.</p>

<p>Governor Stuyvesant was a farmer as well as a soldier and there is
something in history and much in tradition of the Bowery Farm, which
flourished on the site of the present Bowery in New York. This farm was
planted and tended by "Peter, the Headstrong" when he was not disputing
with his burgomasters, watching the Yankees and fighting Swedes
and Indians. The orchards and gardens, according to all accounts, were
remarkably fine and were kept in a high state of cultivation. Stuyvesant
founded the farm during the stormy times of his governorship but did
not live on it until the English took possession of New Amsterdam in
1664 when he retired to the land and devoted the eighteen remaining years
of his life to agriculture. From the neighboring colonies and from abroad
he brought many fruits, flowers, farm and truck crops. Fruits came to
him also from Holland and were disseminated from his orchard up the
Hudson.</p>

<p>The cherry was one of the fruits much grown by the Dutch. It would
be wearisome and would serve little purpose even to attempt a cursory
review of the literature of colonial days in New York showing the spread
and the extent of fruit culture by the Dutch. Travel up the Hudson
and its branches was easy and within a century after the settlement of
New York by the Dutch, cherries were not only cultivated by the whites,
according to the records of travelers, naturalists and missionaries, but
were rudely tilled by the Indians.</p>

<p>For a long time after its introduction in New York, the cherry, in
common with other fruits, was grown as a species&mdash;varieties and budded
or grafted trees were probably not known. Fruit-growing as an industry
began in New York and in America, with the establishment of a nursery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
at Flushing, Long Island, in 1730, by Robert Prince, founder of the nursery
which afterwards became the famous Linnæan Botanic Garden. At what
date this nursery began to offer named cherries for sale cannot be said
but advertisements appearing in 1767, 1774 and 1794 show that budded
or grafted named cherries were being offered for sale by the Princes. In
1804, William Prince, third proprietor of the famous Flushing nursery,
prepared a list of the named cherries then under cultivation in America
for Willich's <cite>Domestic Encyclopaedia</cite>, an English work which was being
edited and made "applicable to the present situation of the United States"
by Dr. James Mease. The following is Prince's list:<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<ul>

<h3>CHERRIES IN THE SOUTH</h3>

<p>It would be interesting but hardly of sufficient profit to trace further
the history of cultivated cherries in the states of the Atlantic seaboard.
References to the cherry abound in the colonial records of Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Delaware but they bring out no facts differing materially
from those abstracted from the records of the northern colonies. The
Quakers and the Swedes in the states watered by the Delaware and the
English in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina, all early grew cherries
as one of the easiest fruits to propagate and cultivate.</p>

<p>Space can be spared for but two brief quotations to show the condition
of cherry culture in the South in Colonial days. The first is from
Bruce's Economic History of Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the closing years of the seventeenth century, there were few
plantations in Virginia which did not possess orchards of apple and peach
trees, pear, plum, apricot and quince.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The number of trees was often
very large. The orchard of Robert Hide of York<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> contained three hundred
peach and three hundred apple trees. There were twenty-five hundred
apple trees in the orchard of Colonel Fitzhugh.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Each species of fruit
was represented by many varieties; thus, of the apple, there were mains,
pippins, russentens, costards, marigolds, kings, magitens and bachelors; of
the pear, bergamy and warden. The quince was greater in size, but less
acidulated than the English quince; on the other hand, the apricot and
plum were inferior in quality to the English, not ripening in the same
perfection.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Cherries grew in notable abundance. So great was the
productive capacity of the peach that some of the landowners planted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
orchards of the tree for the mere purpose of using the fruit to fatten their
hogs;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> on some plantations, as many as forty bushels are said to have
been knocked down to the swine in the course of a single season."<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The second quotation is from Lawson's History of Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have the common, red and black cherry, which bear well.
I never saw any grafted in this country, the common excepted, which
was grafted on an indian plum stock, and bore well. This is a good way,
because our common cherry trees are very apt to put scions all around
the tree for a great distance, which must needs be prejudicial to the tree
and fruit. Not only our cherries are apt to do so, but our apples and
most other fruit trees, which may chiefly be imputed to the negligence
and unskillfulness of the gardner. Our cherries are ripe a month sooner
than in Virginia."</p></blockquote>

<h3>CHERRIES IN THE MIDDLE WEST</h3>

<p>At a surprisingly early date the cherry, with the apple, peach, pear
and plum, was being grown far inland in the New World. Southeastern
Michigan was settled in 1701 at Detroit and within a half-century settlements
had been made at Vincennes, Indiana; Kaskaskia and Cahokia,
Illinois; and at Saint Louis and several other points in Missouri. The
orchards and gardens of the early French settlers in these states live in
the traditions of all the settlements; but much more substantial evidence
was to be found a century ago, and in the case of the apple and pear may
still be found, in the venerable trees of all the tree-fruit in and about
these old French posts. "The homes of these pioneers," so good an
authority as Parkman tells us, "were generally placed in gardens surrounded
by fruit trees of apples, pears, cherries and peaches." Were
proof lacking of these early plantations, it might be assumed that people
so fond of horticulture as the French would not long be unmindful of the
value to themselves and their posterity of plantations of fruit trees.</p>

<h3>CHERRIES ON THE PACIFIC COAST</h3>

<p>The history of the cherry in America is not complete without some
mention of its introduction, culture and the development of new varieties
on the Pacific coast. Indeed, it is not too much to say that at no time
nor at any place in its whole history has the cherry made greater advancement
than during the last half-century in Oregon, California and Washington&mdash;naming
the states in order of their contribution to cherry culture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>At about the time the colonies were beginning their struggle with the
mother country for independence, Franciscan monks were establishing
missions in California. To these they brought seeds of fruits, grains,
flowers and vegetables, as several historians of the missions tell us, and
as the trees found by Americans a few decades later make certain as regards
fruits. It is probable that by the close of the Revolutionary war all subtropical
and temperate fruits of Europe were to be found cultivated in
the missions of California. Among these, in an enumeration of the products
of the missions, the cherry is listed by E. S. Capson.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> From its introduction
at approximately the close of the Eighteenth Century, the cherry continued
to be cultivated, at times more or less sparsely to be sure, until,
by conquest in the war with Mexico, California passed into the possession
of the United States. A new era in horticulture began in California soon
after the influx of gold-seekers in 1849, some of whom, noting the opportunities
of fruit-growing, at once began the importation of seeds and plants.</p>

<p>Modern fruit-growing on the Pacific Coast, however, began in Oregon.
The California Argonauts of '49 were much too busily engaged in digging
gold to think of getting it indirectly by tilling the soil, whereas the men
who were then crossing the plains from Missouri or sailing around the
Horn from New England to Oregon were home-makers and true tillers
of the soil. These early Oregonians were the forerunners in the zeal and
enterprise which have made horticulture on this coast the marvel of modern
agriculture. But one of the several early horticulturists of Oregon can
be mentioned here, he deserving special mention by virtue of his work
with cherries.</p>

<p>Until 1847 the few cultivated fruits to be found in Oregon were seedlings
mostly grown by employees of the Hudson Bay Fur Company. In
that year there was a notable importation of cultivated fruits across the
plains&mdash;a venture which quickly proved pregnant with results in fruit
harvests which have not ceased and give promise long to continue.
Henderson Lewelling crossed the plains from Henry County, Iowa, and
brought with him a choice selection of grafted fruits. These he transported
in boxes of soil which he hauled in a wagon drawn by oxen. Arriving
in Oregon late in the fall of 1847 he found that he had 300 trees alive which
he planted at what is now Milwaukee, a few miles south of Portland on
the east side of the Willamette River. Later, seeds were brought for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
stocks, though for the cherry the wild species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus emarginata</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus virginiana</i>, were used and very successfully, until Mazzard and
Mahaleb seeds could be obtained. In this travelling nursery, Lewelling
brought to Oregon cherries of the Bigarreau, the English Morello and
probably of several other types. The label of one of the cherries was lost
and this unknown was renamed Royal Ann. Unfortunately, it was one of
the best known of all cherries that for the time being lost its identity&mdash;the
Napoleon, which probably has been cultivated for three centuries and
since 1820 has borne the name of the great General. With dogged
perseverance the West Coast fruit-growers continue the name "Royal
Ann" to the great confusion of systematic pomology.</p>

<p>But of chief import to cherry culture were the subsequent operations in
the Lewelling nursery at Milwaukee. Lacking proper stocks, Seth Lewelling,
who had succeeded Henderson in the nursery business, grew a great
many cherries from seeds. From these he afterward selected and disseminated
varieties that have made Oregon famous not only for what
are probably the finest sweet cherries in the world but for a long list of
new and desirable varieties&mdash;as Republican, Lincoln, Willamette Seedling
and Bing. We call to mind no greater success in bringing into being new
fruits from a few lots of seedlings than in the case of Lewelling and his
cherries. Lewelling's work stimulated others to breed cherries and among
many seedlings that have since been named in the Northwest the Lambert
and Oregon are well worthy of mention.</p>

<p>The facts of time and place in the beginning of cherry culture which
we have tried to set forth in this chapter have, we think, some historical
and narrative interest. Yet, the main value of the facts are not in history
and story. Rather, at least so we hope they will be interpreted, these
brief records show what the crude material was out of which our present
cultivated cherry flora has been developed; what the steps were in the
domestication and development of the cherry; what economic purposes
they have served; and who the peoples are and what the methods were
in bringing the cherry to its present state of development. In a word,
the chapter will not have served the purpose for which it is mainly intended
if it does not furnish facts and inspirations toward the further evolution
of the cherry.

<h2 id="Chapt_III">CHAPTER III<br />

CHERRY CULTURE</h2>

<p>The magnitude of the cherry industry in the United States is not
generally appreciated. This is because cherries are very largely grown
in small home plantations and the product is either consumed at home
and in local markets, or is sent to canning factories and is therefore disposed
of without the display attending the production and marketing of fruits sold
in the general market. The following figures from the last census show the
importance of the industry. There were in 1909, according to the census
taken in 1910, 11,822,044 bearing cherry trees in the United States and
5,621,660 trees not of bearing age. The bearing trees bore 4,126,099
bushels of fruit valued at $7,231,160. When this, the thirteenth census,
was taken, the cherry ranked fifth in commercial value among orchard fruits,
being surpassed in the order named by the apple, peach, plum and pear.</p>

<p>The yield of fruit was 43.6 per centum greater in 1909 than in 1899.
This high percentage of increase has been brought about in several ways.
The recent development of rapid transportation, refrigerator service and
of marketing facilities has greatly stimulated the culture of this as of all
other fruits in the United States. An increased demand for canned and
preserved cherries has sprung up so that cherries are much more used
now than formerly, the trade in preserved cherries for confections and
various drinks in particular having greatly increased. Lastly, better care
of orchards and better means of combating insects and fungi have increased
the yields during the last decade.</p>

<p>Cherries are grown in greater or less quantities in every state in the
Union but commercially the industry is confined to a few states having
especial advantages in climate, soil and markets. In but six states, according
to the last census, was the value of the cherry crop more than a half-million
dollars, the states being: California $951,654, Pennsylvania $909,975,
Ohio $657,406, Michigan $590,829, New York $544,508, Indiana $508,516.
In New York in particular, recent plantings of this fruit have been so
great that at this writing, July, 1914, the figures given for this State could
be increased by a quarter at the very least, and no doubt they could be
largely increased also for California and Michigan. The great growth
of the canning industry is most largely responsible for the large plantings
of cherries in recent years in regions especially suited to this fruit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>In the several states named, the cherry industry is further localized.
Thus, in the 61 counties in New York, the cherry is grown largely in but
12, the number of trees in each of these being: Columbia 78,526, Niagara
61,786, Monroe 49,831, Ontario 36,394, Wayne 35,385, Erie 29,483, Onondaga
25,932, Seneca 27,063, Chautauqua 24,483, Steuben 15,412, Orleans
14,682 and Cayuga 14,319. If the figures just given, the total number
being 413,296, are compared with the number of trees in the State, 674,000,
it will be seen that the industry is quite localized, two-thirds of the cherries
being grown in 12 of the 61 counties, though the fact is brought out in the
census that cherries are grown on 59,408 farms in New York, showing
that this fruit is much grown for home use. Further figures of interest
as regards New York are that the cherry crop in 1909 amounted to 271,597
bushels which sold for $544,508. The plantings in the State cover in
the neighborhood of 9,500 acres.</p>

<p>A canvass of the leading cherry-growers and nurserymen in the United
States shows that, in all parts of the country excepting California, Oregon
and Washington, Sour Cherries are much more commonly grown than
Sweet Cherries. In New York at least 90 per cent of the cherry trees are of
sour varieties and this proportion will hold for the region east of the Rockies.
The leading commercial varieties of Sour Cherries, in order named, are
Montmorency, Early Richmond and English Morello. No other variety
is nearly as commonly grown as is even the least well known of these three.
No one of the Duke cherries is mentioned as of commercial importance,
but May Duke, Late Duke and Reine Hortense are frequently grown in
home plantations.</p>

<p>Growers of Sweet Cherries are not nearly as closely in accord as to
the best varieties as are those who grow sour sorts. The most popular
Sweet Cherries in the East seem to be Windsor, Black Tartarian, Napoleon
and Wood with a very insistent statement of the few who have tried it
that Schmidt is better than any of these for the market. On the Pacific
Coast honors go to Napoleon, which the Westerners continue to call Royal
Ann despite the fact that it has been cultivated for three centuries and
had been called Napoleon for nearly a half-century before Lewelling took
it to Oregon in 1847. Other popular sorts on the Pacific seaboard are
Bing, Lambert and Republican&mdash;all western productions.</p>

<p>Rather more important than the information obtained from growers
of cherry trees as to varieties was that as to the stocks on which cherries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
are grown in America. This brings us to a discussion of the whole subject
of stocks for cherries.</p>

<h3>STOCKS FOR CHERRIES</h3>

<p>Cherries have been grown in America for over 200 years and for 50
years the crop has been important commercially. Yet despite the extent
and the importance of the industry and the years it has been in existence,
curiously enough so fundamental a question as the best stock upon which
to grow cherries has not yet been settled; indeed, though cherries behave
markedly different on the several stocks, interest as to which is the best
seems but recently to have been aroused. Now there is a rather warm
controversy as to which is the better of the two leading stocks, the Mazzard
or the Mahaleb.</p>

<p>Fruit-growers on one side hold that the Mazzard is the best stock
for all orchard varieties of this fruit while nurserymen controvert this
view and say that the Mahaleb is at least a fit stock for sweet sorts and
is the best one for Sour Cherries, and, moreover, that it is now impossible
to grow cherries on Mazzard roots at prices that fruit-growers are willing
to pay. Since no systematic attempts seem to have been made to determine
the peculiarities and values of these two and other cherry stocks
both sides dispute without many facts. Meanwhile, a fine crop of misunderstandings
has grown up about the whole matter of cherry stocks.
It is worth while to attempt to clear up some of the misunderstandings.
The first step toward this end is to describe and give the botanical and
horticultural relationships of the Mazzard and Mahaleb cherries to orchard
cherries.</p>

<p>The Mazzard, as we have seen, is a common name, of uncertain origin,
of the wild Sweet Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, from which has come all cultivated
Sweet Cherries. It is important to recall that the trees of the
Mazzard reach a height of thirty or forty feet and the trunk often attains
a diameter of eighteen or twenty inches. Other characters to be kept
in mind are that the Mazzard lacks hardiness to cold but grows vigorously
and is usually healthy, though susceptible to several fungi, one of which,
the shot-hole fungus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cylindrosporium padi</i>, makes it a most difficult plant
to grow in the nursery. Trees and fruit coming from the Mazzard used as
a stock are very uniform, a fact easy to ascertain in New York where this
stock has been largely used for nearly a century. The Mazzard is almost
always grown from seed for stocks though suckers are occasionally used&mdash;a
poor practice.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<img src="images/illus-068.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">PRUNUS AVIUM</i> (MAZZARD)</p>
</div>

<p>The Mazzard, or at least the Sweet Cherry, has probably been more
or less used as a stock since the earliest cultivation of this fruit. The
Greeks and Romans practiced budding and grafting centuries before Christ's
time and when the cherry came to them as a domesticated fruit, at least
three or four centuries before Christ, they undoubtedly made use of budding
and grafting<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> to maintain varieties and in the case of the Sour Cherry,
if they had it, and they probably did, to avoid the suckers that spring
from the roots of the trees. The literature of fruit-growing is scant and
fragmentary during the Middle Ages but beginning with the herbals in
the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries there are many treatises on fruits
and botany and in several of these the use of the wild Sweet Cherry, the
Mazzard, is mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>In America the Mazzard as a stock probably came into use soon after
the establishment of Prince's nursery at Flushing, Long Island, about 1730,
budding and grafting seeming to have been little practiced in the New
World before the founding of this nursery.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The use of the Mazzard
as a stock is mentioned probably for the first in Coxe's <cite>Fruit Trees</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
second American treatise on fruits, published in 1817, and again in
Thacher's <cite>American Orchardist</cite>, published in 1822.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Both authors, as
the foot-notes show, speak of the use of this stock as if it were in common
use in American nurseries. Neither mentions the Mahaleb.</p>

<p>The Mahaleb, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i>, it will be remembered from the
description previously given, is a bush or bush-like cherry, sometimes
but not often attaining the height and port of a tree. The top is thick,
with rather slender ramifying branches bearing small, green, smooth,
glossy leaves, which resemble those of the apricot more than they do the
leaves of either species of orchard cherries. The fruits are at first green,
then yellowish, turning to red and at full maturity are shining, black and
so hard, bitter and astringent as to be scarcely edible. This brief
description of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus mahaleb</i> shows that it is quite distinct from either our
commonly cultivated Sweet Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>, or the Sour Cherry,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, differing from either much more than the two edible species
differ from each other. It is quite as far removed from the Sweet or the
Sour Cherry botanically as the apple is from the pear, the quince, or the
thorn and if anything more distantly related than orchard cherries are
to plums. One would expect the wood structure of the Mahaleb to differ
from that of Sweet or Sour Cherries very materially and that even if the
union proved in budding or grafting wholly normal that there would
be some difficulty in the proper passage of nutritive solutions between
stock and cion. This cherry, as we have seen, is propagated almost entirely
from seed though it may easily be grown from layers, cuttings and suckers.
The American supply of Mahaleb stock comes from France.</p>

<p>The Mahaleb seems to have come into use as a stock for other cherries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
in France having been first mentioned for this purpose by Duhamel du
Monceau in his <cite>Traite des Arbres Fruitiers</cite> in 1768.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Miller in his <cite>Gardener's Dictionary</cite>, 1754, describes the Mahaleb cherry
and says it was "Cultivated in 1714 by the Duchess of Beaufort." This
seems to be the first mention of its culture in England though Gerarde
in <cite>The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes</cite> describes it. Neither mentions
its use as a stock. In fact, it seems not to have been mentioned as a stock
in England until 1824 when Loudon in the <cite>Encyclopedia of Gardening</cite>
speaks of it as "the most effectual dwarfing stock."<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>It was not until after the middle of the Nineteenth Century that
the Mahaleb came into use in America, none of the horticultural writers
in the first half of the last century, as Cobbett, 1803; McMahon, 1806;
Coxe, 1817; Thacher, 1822; Prince, 1828; Kenrick, 1833; Manning, 1838;
Thomas, 1846; Floy, 1846, nor Cole, 1849, having mentioned the Mahaleb
though nearly all speak of the Mazzard as the stock upon which cherries
are budded. Downing, in 1845, makes first mention of the Mahaleb as
a stock in the New World;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Thomas in his second edition, 1851, recommends
it as a stock to dwarf cherries;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Barry, 1852, says that Mahaleb
stock is imported from Europe;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> while Elliott, in 1854, also speaks of it as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
a dwarfing stock.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> From this date on the Mahaleb is mentioned in all
American works on pomology in which stocks for cherries are discussed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50" id="illus-070">
<a href="images/illus-070.jpg">
<img src="images/illus-070.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">PRUNUS MAHALEB</i></p>
</div>

<p>Pains have been taken to show the exact date the Mahaleb began
to be used as a stock in America. The quotations show that this was
about 1850. They show, too, that at first and for a long time its only
use was as a dwarfing stock. But now the Mahaleb has almost wholly
superseded the Mazzard as a stock for all Sweet and Sour Cherries. Not
many cherries were propagated on the new stock until after 1860 when
its use, if we may judge from the accounts of fruit-growing, began to be
general and it grew so rapidly in favor that by 1880 it was more popular
than the Mazzard and in another decade had almost wholly taken the
place of the latter. Probably 95 per centum of the cherries grown in
this country are budded on the Mahaleb. Why has the Mahaleb supplanted
the Mazzard? This is the question that immediately comes to
mind and to the discussion of which we proceed.</p>

<p>There is no question but that it is much easier to grow cherry trees
on Mahaleb stock in the nursery than on Mazzard and that usually a better
looking tree can be delivered to the fruit-grower on the first-named stock.
Seedlings of both stocks are imported from Europe and those of the
Mahaleb are usually cheaper. These reasons are sufficient for the
exclusive use of Mahaleb by nurserymen, and, were it certain that the
Mahaleb is the best stock for the fruit-grower, all hands might forthwith
renounce the Mazzard. In what respects is it easier to grow cherries on
the Mahaleb in the nursery than on the Mazzard?</p>

<p>All know that the Sweet Cherry is a little difficult to grow&mdash;is capricious
as to soils, climates, cultivation and pruning, and as to diseases
and insects. The Mazzard now used for stocks has the faults of the species
to which it belongs. The Mahaleb, on the other hand, is adapted to
a greater diversity of soils; is hardier to either heat or cold; less particular
about cultivation; will stand more cutting in the nursery if pruning be
necessary; is less susceptible to aphids which in many parts of the United
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
States trouble cherries in the nursery row; and, more to the point than all
else, in New York at least, is not nearly as badly infested with the shot-hole
fungus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cylindrosporium padi</i>, which often ruins plantations of Mazzard
stock. Mahaleb stock, too, is more easily "worked" than the
Mazzard both in the actual work of budding and in having a longer season
for this nursery operation. Cherries on Mahaleb ripen their wood earlier
than those on Mazzard and may thus be dug earlier in the fall.</p>

<p>Nurserymen and fruit-growers alike agree to this statement of the
superior merits of the Mahaleb as a nursery plant. The facts set forth
are matters of common observation&mdash;so well known that it is not necessary
to verify them experimentally. A half-century of experience in America
on many soils, in many climates and under widely varied conditions has
demonstrated that it is easier to grow cherries in the nursery on the Mahaleb
than on the Mazzard stock.</p>

<p>From experience in the orchard, fruit-growers have established several
facts as to the relative value of Mazzard and Mahaleb stocks from their
standpoint. These are:</p>

<p>1. Cherries on Mahaleb are hardier to cold than those on Mazzard
stocks. This hardiness is due, in part at least, to the fact that cherry
wood on Mahaleb ripens sooner than on Mazzard. This superior hardiness
of the Mahaleb is evident in the nursery-row as well as in the
orchard and is a matter of great importance in northern nursery regions.
In this connection it should be said that the Mahaleb is not as hardy as
might be wished and that there are, as we shall later show, still hardier
stocks.</p>

<p>2. There is no question but that the Mahaleb is a dwarfing stock.
It came into use and in Europe continues to serve almost the sole purpose
of dwarfing varieties worked upon it. This retarding effect is not fully
realized by American cherry-growers because for the first few years the
diminution in size is not apparent and even at the close of a decade the
difference in size is not as marked as it would be between standard and
dwarf apples or pears of the same age.</p>

<p>3. Cherry-growers who have tried both stocks agree that most varieties
come in bearing earlier on Mahaleb than on Mazzard stocks. From
the known effects of dwarfing on other fruit trees this would be expected.</p>

<p>4. The size of the cherries is the same on trees grown on the two
stocks. The claim is made that apples and pears are a little larger on
dwarf trees and that when peaches and plums are dwarfed the fruit is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
smaller. No one seems to have seen or to have thought that there are
differences in the size of cherries grown on Mazzard or Mahaleb stock.</p>

<p class="caption"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">PRUNUS AVIUM</i> (MAZZARD)</p>
</div>

<p>5. Better unions are made with Mazzard than with the Mahaleb.
This would be expected because of the close relationship of the Mazzard
to orchard cherries.</p>

<p>6. The Mahaleb is probably the more cosmopolitan stock&mdash;will thrive
on a greater diversity of soils than the Mazzard stock. In particular it
is somewhat better adapted to sandy, light, stony, and arid soils that are
not well adapted to growing cherries. Its root system is much nearer
the surface of the ground and it is, therefore, better adapted to shallow
soils than the Mazzard.</p>

<p>7. Though the evidence is somewhat conflicting on this point it is
probable that cherries on Mazzard live longer than on Mahaleb. It may
be that the frequent statements to this effect arise from the knowledge
that dwarf fruit-trees are generally shorter lived than standard trees since
there seem to be no records of actual comparisons.</p>

<p>8. Lastly, in climates where the cherry can be grown with reasonable
certainty and in soils to which this fruit is adapted, varieties on Mazzard
are more productive and profitable than on the Mahaleb stock. This
seems to be the concensus of opinion among growers in the great cherry
regions of California, Oregon, Washington, Michigan and New York.</p>

<p>Several other stocks have been more or less successfully used for
cherries and a great number have never been tried that might make good
stocks. In a country as diversified as ours and in a state as variable in
soil and climate as New York and with the manifold varieties of Sweet
and Sour Cherries, it is almost certain that under some conditions there
are stocks more desirable than either Mazzard or Mahaleb. The resources
of the cherry-grower in this direction are so great that in this account
we can but briefly outline them, describing but a few of the many stocks
that might be used.</p>

<p>In the colder parts of New York and of the United States, undoubtedly
seedlings of Russian cherries would make hardy and in most other respects
very desirable stocks. These Russian cherries, too, as a rule, come nearly
or quite true to seed, making very good orchard plants on their own roots.
Some of them, if not most of them, sprout rather badly&mdash;not so serious
a fault as one might think, especially in a cultivated orchard. For budding
over to other varieties only sour sorts should be used, taking for trial such
varieties as Bessarabian, Brusseler Braune, Double Natte, George Glass,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Lutovka, Early Morello, Ostheim and Vladimir. Probably most of these
would dwarf standard varieties more or less but in no case is it to be supposed
that they would have the dwarfing effect of Mahaleb. In the North
Mississippi Valley some of these, especially of the Ostheim or Morello
type, have been very successfully used as stocks.</p>

<p>The small, wild, red cherry locally known as the Bird, Pin and as
the Pigeon Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pennsylvanica</i>, found from the Atlantic to
the eastern slopes of the Coast Range on the Pacific in northern United
States and southern Canada, is often used as a hardy stock. The writer
has seen it so used in northern Michigan but from his observation can
recommend it only for cold regions and as a makeshift since it dwarfs
standard varieties and usually suckers badly. W. T. Macoun, Ottawa,
Canada, Dominion Horticulturist, states that this stock is commonly
used in the colder parts of Canada and with good results. This cherry
is not as distantly related to orchard varieties as the Mahaleb and unites
with Sour Cherries at least as readily as does the Mahaleb.</p>

<p>In the West and Northwest the Sand Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pumila</i>, is used
very successfully in cold, dry regions as a stock for Sour Cherries. The
following is a very good account of its behavior from the pen of the late
Professor J. L. Budd, a pioneer cherry grower in the Middle West.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those who have seen acres of the Sandy Cherry in the northwest
loaded with fruit have not been ready to believe it a good stock for the
cherry on account of its sprawling bushy habits of growth. But those
who have watched its growth when young under culture on rich soil can
comprehend the fact that it is as easy to work as the Mahaleb. As with
the Mahaleb the seedlings grown in seed bed will be large enough to set
in nursery row the next spring, and of good size for August budding. To
illustrate its rapidity and uprightness of growth I will state that we rooted
a few cuttings in plant house last winter. When set in nursery they had
made a show of growth of from two to four inches, yet at budding time,
the middle of August, they were fully as large, stocky and upright as the
Mahalebs, and in all respects in as perfect condition for budding.</p>

<p>"This hardiest of all cherries is very closely related to our garden
cherries, so nearly indeed that our botanists long ago decided that valuable
crosses on it might be made.</p>

<p>"As yet its use for stocks is somewhat experimental, but we can say
positively that it united well with our hardy sorts in budding, and it does
not dwarf the sorts worked upon it to a greater extent during the first
five years of growth than does the Mahaleb."</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>There are records of the Choke Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus virginiana</i>,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and of the
Rum, or wild Black Cherry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus serotina</i>, having been used as stocks
but these long-bunch, or racemose, cherries are so distantly related to the
short-bunch, or fascicled, orchard cherries that it would seem that their use
would be desirable only under great stress.</p>

<p>In Japan a horticultural variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pseudocerasus</i> is used
as a stock. Of this cherry for this purpose, Professor Yugo Hoshino of
the Tohoku Imperial University at Sapporo, Japan, writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You wish to know about the cherry stocks used in this country.
It is very rare to use our common wild cherry as a stock for European
cherries. In Hokkaido (Yozo Island), we commonly use the seedlings of
European Sweet and Sour Cherries as stocks. But in the northern part
of Japan proper (Main Island), it is a common practice to graft European
cherries on a special kind of our cherry. This cherry has particular characters
which fit it for propagation; namely, it roots very easily either from
cuttings or by layering (mound). Its botanical position is not certain,
but it is probable that it is a cultural variety of Pseudocerasus, especially
bred for stock purposes. It is grown by nurserymen only and called Dai-Sakura.
(<i>Dai</i> means stock: <i>Sakura</i> means cherry.) It has a somewhat
dwarfing influence on cions and hastens their fruiting age."</p></blockquote>

<p>This stock ought to be tried in America if, indeed, it is not already
under cultivation from introductions made by the United States Department
of Agriculture.</p>

<p>These are but a few of many cherries that have been or might be
tried as stocks for orchard varieties. There are many species of cherries
more closely related to the cultivated edible sorts than the Mahaleb.
Many of the cherries from Asia, not now known to growers, will eventually
find their way to America; a few have already been introduced by the
United States Department of Agriculture; some of them can undoubtedly
be used as stocks and from them we may hope to find a better stock than
either the Mazzard or Mahaleb.</p>

<p>Cherries are now grown almost wholly as budded trees but they can
be more or less readily root-grafted, depending upon the variety. Under
some circumstances it might be profitable to propagate them by grafting.
Usually it is necessary to use a whole root and to graft at the crown of
the stock. Budd recommends this practice for Iowa, using Mazzard stock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
but with the expectation that the cion will take root and eventually the
tree will stand on its own roots.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> We cannot believe, however, that grafting
can ever take the place of budding as a nursery practice or that it can
be profitably used except in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>Buds in propagating are usually taken from nursery stock, a practice
of decades, and there is no wearing out of varieties. Old varieties have
lost none of the characters accredited to them a century, or several
centuries, ago by pomological writers. Nor does it seem to matter, in
respect to trueness to type, whether the buds be taken from a vigorous,
young stripling, a mature tree in the heyday of life or some struggling,
lichen-covered ancient&mdash;all alike reproduce the variety. The hypothesis
that fruit-trees degenerate or, on the other hand, that they may be improved
by bud-selection, finds no substantiation in this fruit. There seems to
be no limit to the number of times its varieties can be propagated true
to type from buds.</p>

<h3>CHERRY CLIMATES AND CHERRY SOILS</h3>

<p>Climate and soil have been the chief determinants of location for
cherry-growing in New York. Both Sweet Cherries and Sour Cherries
are profoundly influenced by the natural environment in which they are
grown&mdash;Sweet Cherries rather more so than any other fruit, either climate
or soil dictating whether they may or may not be grown.</p>

<p>The Sour Cherry is at home in a great variety of climates, the vagaries
of weather affecting it but little. It is probably the hardiest to cold,
in some of its varieties at least, of all our tree fruits, thriving almost to
the Arctic Circle and from there southward, in some of its forms, quite
to the limits of the Temperate Zone. The blossoming season is relatively
late so that fruit-setting is seldom prevented by spring frosts. Yet, even
with this hardy fruit, it is necessary to take thought of heat and cold in
growing commercial crops; for spring frosts may wither the bloom or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
summer heat and wind blast the crop if the orchard site be not well selected
as regards local weather.</p>

<p>The Sweet Cherry, on the other hand, must be coddled in every turn
of the season, in climatic requirements being particularly sensitive to
heat and cold. This cherry stands with the peach in not being able to
survive temperatures much below zero and in suffering greatly from spring
frosts because of early blooming. It is even more susceptible to heat than
the peach, and especially cannot endure long-continued heat, both fruit and
foliage suffering. The Sweet Cherry is at its best in a warm, sunny, genial,
equable climate. The Duke cherries, hybrids between the Sweet and the
Sour species, in the matter of hardiness are midway between the hardy Sours
and the tender Sweets though this is but a very general statement applying
to the group as a whole and not to individual varieties. Some of these
withstand cold and heat well while others are tender in either extreme.</p>

<p>Cherries are more at the mercy of moisture than of temperature conditions.
Continued rain at blossoming time will almost surely prevent
a proper setting of fruit; and the cherries crack, and brown-rot becomes
exceedingly aggressive if there is wet weather in harvest time. Late
summer rainfall to supply moisture to the trees is a matter of small concern to
the cherry-grower, for growth begins early and the crop is off the trees before
summer droughts usually begin. Where irrigation is practiced water for
the cherry is safely supplied at most seasons of the year except when harvest
is in swing at which time the cherries will swell and crack if there be
too much water.</p>

<p>As with all fruits the direction, temperature and humidity of winds
are factors which decree whether or not cherries can be grown profitably
either in a locality or a region. A pocket in the hills filled with dead air
or a wind-swept highland would be unsatisfactory extremes; for, in the
first case, fungi, especially the dreaded brown-rot, would take too great
toll, and, in the second, blossoms would be blasted or foliage frazzled and
the fruit whipped. The harsh, drying winds of winter, too, would be
disastrous to Sweet Cherry culture and if extreme, as on the Great Plains,
wood and buds of Sour Cherries would suffer. Artificial wind-breaks have
not been found profitable in the hilly and wooded East, entailing too many
disadvantages, but if cherries be planted at all in the prairies of the Middle
West, some protection from the winds must usually be provided.</p>

<p>The two species from which cultivated cherries come grow with proper
vigor in quite different soils. The Sour Cherry and most of its hybrid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
offspring, the Dukes, may be made to grow in almost any arable soil, but
the Sweet Cherry is fastidious&mdash;to be pleased only by particular soils.</p>

<p>Sour Cherry orchards in New York most excel on strong, even-tempered,
loamy soils, naturally or artificially well drained yet retentive of
moisture. There is possibly a shade of difference in favor of clay loams
and some thriving plantations may be found on stiff clays having good
depth and good drainage. Wet, sticky clays underlaid with a cold, clammy
subsoil&mdash;a combination all too common in Central New York&mdash;furnish
conditions which defy the best of care and culture.</p>

<p>Sweet Cherry orchards are found excelling on lighter, and less fertile
soils than those we have described for the grosser feeding Sours. Growers
of Sweet Cherries conceive a perfect soil for this fruit to be a naturally
dry, warm, deep, free-working, gravelly or sandy loam. If the soil is not
naturally dry, it must be made so by artificial drainage, for this fruit is
most impatient of too much moisture or a root-run restricted by water.
In Sweet Cherry soils, as will be surmised, it is difficult to supply humus
yet this must be done either by cover crops or by manure to make the
soil sufficiently retentive of moisture. Sweet Cherries can be grown on
other soils than those under discussion but, for a large, firm, finely finished
product for the markets, only the soils described are suitable.</p>

<p>The conditions of soil and climate, as we have briefly defined them, that
favor cherry culture are to be found in several parts of New York. Briefly
we may name and describe the cherry regions of the State as follows:</p>

<p>The undulating, maritime plains of Long Island, covered with a thick
deposit of sand, are very well adapted to cherries where the soil is rich
enough to come under the plow. The genial climate, with its rather heavy
rainfall, is precisely that in which the cherry thrives, the region falling
short in the poorness of the soil&mdash;a fault easily remedied, where there
is good bottom, by manuring. Despite the fact that occasional trees and
plantations show that this fruit thrives on Long Island the cherry is not
much grown here, the industry needing some leader to show the way.</p>

<p>The valley of the Hudson from where the river leaves the mountains
on the north to its entrance into the highlands of its lower stretch is
admirably adapted to cherry-growing, both climate and soil meeting the
requirements of this fruit. In parts of the valley the industry has been
developed, Columbia County taking first place among the counties of the
State, with its 78,526 trees in 1909. The product of this region goes
chiefly to the great city market near at hand. Unfortunately the standard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of cultivation is low in the Hudson Valley and the handling and marketing
of the crop is also on a lower level than westward in the State. The cherry
harvest is earlier here than elsewhere in New York, if we except the small
crop of Long Island, an advantage, for prices usually fall rather than
stiffen as the season advances.</p>

<p>The great basin in which lie the Central Lakes of New York is far
famed for its Sour Cherry industry, the product going largely to canneries.
Some Sweet Cherries are grown&mdash;more and more are being planted&mdash;about
these lakes; but the rich, heavy soils which mostly prevail hereabouts
are more fit for varieties of the Sour Cherry; though the equable
climate makes almost certain the Sweet Cherry crop on soils suited to
its culture. Here, as elsewhere in the State, the acreage at this writing
is greatly on the increase though it is doubtful if the advance will much
longer weather the present depression in prices. All through this region,
as in that to the north, the Sweet Cherry grows wild, thriving like the
Biblical bay&mdash;seemingly a sheer gift of the soil and, like other gifts,
generally neglected.</p>

<p>The high plain along the shore of Lake Ontario from the St. Lawrence
River to the Niagara River, extending from the lake on the north from
ten to fifteen miles inland, is the region of greatest possibilities for the
cherry in New York. The climate of this great stretch of territory is
nearly perfect for this fruit and the soils are sufficiently diversified to furnish
a suitable habitat for any of the many varieties of either Sweet or Sour
cherries. In the past there have been so many ups and downs in the
cherry industry that fruit-growers in this favored belt have given more
attention to other fruits but for the last decade, until the recent downward
turn in the cherry market, the plantings have been greatly increased,
both Sweet and Sour cherries finding favor.</p>

<p>Not unlike the Ontario shore in climate, but quite unlike it in its
soils, is the shore of Lake Erie, the most westward topographical division
of New York in which cherries are grown. The mainstay of this region
is the grape, but, in seeking for a more diversified agriculture, Sour Cherry
culture was introduced some twenty years ago and has become a thriving
industry with prospects of continued growth. Here, as is so often the
case in agriculture, credit must be given to some one leader for the development
of a crop and the cherry orchards that dot the landscape for miles
about the home of the late John Spencer speak eloquently of his leadership
in this region.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>A necessary accompaniment to a discussion of climate is a statement
of the dates of blooming of the various sorts of cherries; for often, through
selection with reference to this life event of the plant, injurious climatal
influences may be escaped at blooming-time. In the accompanying table
averages of the blooming dates of varieties of cherries for the years just
past, 1912 to 1914, are given.</p>

<p>In making use of these dates, consideration must be given to the
environment of the orchards at Geneva. The latitude of the Smith
Astronomical Observatory, a quarter of a mile from the Station orchards,
is 42&deg; 52' 46.2"; the altitude of the orchards is from five hundred to five
hundred and twenty-five feet above the sea level. The soil is a stiff and
rather cold clay; the orchards lie about a mile west of Seneca Lake, a body
of water forty miles in length and from one to three and one-half miles
in width and more than six hundred feet deep. The lake has frozen over
but a few times since the region was settled, over a hundred years ago,
and has a very beneficial influence on the adjacent country in lessening
the cold of winter and the heat of summer and in preventing early blooming.</p>

<p>The dates are those of full bloom. They were taken from trees grown
under normal conditions as to pruning, distance apart, and as to all other
factors which might influence the blooming period. An inspection of
the table shows that there is a variation of several days between the time
of full bloom of the different varieties of the same species. These differences
can be utilized in selecting sorts to avoid injury from frost.</p>

<h3>THE POLLINATION OF CHERRIES</h3>

<p>We cannot complain in New York of much uncertainty in the setting
of the cherry crop. Late spring frosts occasionally catch the blossoms
of Sweet varieties but seldom those of the Sour sorts. Cold weather,
especially if accompanied by wet weather, not unfrequently cuts
short the cherry crop by preventing proper setting. There is, however,
no general complaint of poor crops through self-sterility. In fact from
the behavior of perfectly isolated trees in all parts of the State it would
be premised that the cherry is most nearly self-fertile of all tree-fruits.</p>

<p>Yet there may be orchards or seasons in which cross-pollination cuts
a figure, for Gardner<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>, of the Oregon Station, found in experiments carried
on by him in various parts of Oregon that many varieties of Sweet Cherries
in the Pacific Coast environment are self-sterile. The work seems to
have been very carefully done and the conclusions are worth reprinting
in full, bearing in mind that they would be much modified under New
York conditions. Gardener found:</p>

<p>"1. All the varieties of the Sweet Cherry tested are self-sterile. This
self-sterility is in no case due to a lack of germinability of the pollen produced.
On the other hand, the pollen of each of the varieties studied
is capable of producing a set of fruit on the variety or varieties with which
it is inter-fertile. The list includes Bing, Black Republican, Black Tartarian,
Coe, Early Purple, Elton, Knight, Lambert, Major Francis, May
Duke, Napoleon, Rockport, Waterhouse, Willamette, Windsor, Wood.</p>

<p>"2. Certain of these varieties&mdash;Bing, Lambert, and Napoleon are
mentioned especially&mdash;are inter-sterile. Mixed plantings of these three
varieties cannot be expected to set fruit unless the trees are within the
range of influence of some other variety or varieties that are inter-fertile
with them.</p>

<p>"3. Among those studied, Black Republican, Black Tartarian, and
Waterhouse seem to be the most efficient pollenizers for this group of
varieties.</p>

<p>"4. Other good pollenizers that may be mentioned are: Elton, Wood,
Coe, Major Francis, Early Purple. These, however, proved somewhat
variable in their pollenizing abilities.</p>

<p>"5. <i>Some</i> of the seedling trees found in and about cherry orchards
are efficient pollenizers for the three varieties&mdash;Bing, Lambert, Napoleon.
Probably <i>many</i> of these seedling trees are efficient pollenizers, though
the value of any particular seedling can be determined only by experiment
or very careful observation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>"6. At least some members of the Duke group of cherries are capable
of pollinating some of the Bigarreaus.</p>

<p>"7. At least some of the varieties of the Sour Cherry (P. cerasus) are
capable of pollinating some of the Bigarreaus.</p>

<p>"8. Inter-sterility of Sweet Cherry varieties is apparently not correlated
with their closeness of relationship.</p>

<p>"9. The ability of a variety of cherry to set fruit is not entirely
dependent upon the kind of pollen available. Environmental factors are
important."</p>

<p>It is doubtful if New York cherry-growers will need to pay much attention
to cross-pollination but, in case cherry trees are not setting full crops,
and for no other apparent reason, the fertility of the blossoms may well
receive attention. Should varieties be found self-sterile, sorts must be
chosen which come into blossom at the same time, in which case the preceding
table shows the sorts which bloom together or nearly enough so to
make cross-pollination possible.</p>

<h3>CHERRY ORCHARDS AND THEIR CARE</h3>

<p>It is patent to the eye of every passer-by that cherry trees are commonly
set too thickly in most of the orchards in New York. While close
planting is a universal fault, the amount of room differs greatly in
different cherry centers, depending mostly upon the custom in the community,
though, as all confess, it should depend upon the variety and
the soil. The very erroneous notion seems to have prevailed in setting
the plantations now reaching maturity that a large return could
be skimmed from a small area by close setting, Sour Cherries often being
put only twelve feet apart each way and Sweet Cherries, considering their
great size, even closer, at sixteen feet. Experienced growers now put such
dwarf kinds as the Morellos at from sixteen to eighteen, the Montmorencies
and their kind at eighteen to twenty-two; and the large growing Sweet
Cherries at from twenty-four to thirty feet.</p>

<p>Cherries are usually planted two years from the bud. Spring is the
season for setting, though the hardy Sour sorts might often be set
advantageously in late autumn. The losses at setting time are greater
with the cherry than with any other fruit, old hands in fruit-growing losing
trees as well as beginners. An experiment at the Station shows that these
losses are greatly mitigated by a change in the usual method of transplanting.
The custom is to shorten-in all branches of transplanted fruit-trees
but this, with the cherry in particular, removes the largest and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
presumably the best nourished buds&mdash;certainly those from which would
soonest develop the leaves so necessary to sustain the breath of life in
the young plant and to give it a start. In the experiment at this Station
it was found that, if the top of the young tree was reduced by thinning
the branches instead of cutting all back, a much larger proportion of the
trees would strike root and live through our parching summers.</p>

<p>Cherry trees in the past have been headed three or four feet above
the ground but in new plantations they are now usually started lower&mdash;at
half of the above distances. Two forms of top are in vogue, the spire-shape
and the vase-shape. Sour Cherries are almost universally grown
with closed centers but some growers prefer the form of the vase for Sweet
varieties, though the majority hold to trees with central trunks and many
subsidiary branches. Little pruning is done in cherry orchards after the
first two or three years, by which time the sapling has been shaped. Subsequent
pruning consists in removing dead, injured or crowded branches
and an occasional superfluous one. Heading-in finds little favor with
experienced growers. These few statements indicate that the cherry, as
now grown, is pruned but little, and that that little must be done very carefully,
the pruning knife in the hands of a careless man being, with this
fruit, "a sword in the hands of a child."</p>

<p>The general tuning-up in the cultivation of fruits during the past
quarter-century has had its influence on cherry culture. Commercial
orchards are no longer kept in sod and the clean, purposeful cultivation
that has taken the place of grass has doubled the output of cherries, tree
for tree, throughout the State, the difference in yield being especially
noticeable in seasons when drought lies heavy on the land. Cultivation,
as practiced by the best growers, consists of plowing the land in the spring
and then frequently stirring the soil until the first of August, at which
time a cover-crop is sown. If the soil is light, and therefore hungry and
thirsty, the plowing should be done early and the cultivator kept constantly
at work until cherry-picking. Cherry orchards often, without
apparent cause, have an indefinable air of malaise&mdash;look dingy and
unhappy&mdash;such require almost week-to-week cultivation to tide them over
their period of indisposition.</p>

<p>Grain, as well as grass, is discountenanced in cherry orchards, but
cultivated truck and farm crops in young plantations, or, under some conditions,
small fruits, are looked upon as permissible and often pay for
the keep of the young trees until they come into profitable bearing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Cover-crops are in common vogue in cherry orchards in New York and,
since with this fruit they can be sown earlier in the season, are used to
better advantage than in other orchards to furnish a full supply of humus
and to provide nitrogen. Brown-rot, an annual scourge in most cherry
orchards, takes less toll from trees cultivated and cover-cropped, these
operations covering the mummied fruits and keeping the spores they carry
from coming to light and life.</p>

<p>Cherry growers as a rule are not now using fertilizers for their crops.
It would seem that this is not doing duty by the land; but it must be
remembered that the cherry grows vigorously and that over-feeding may
stimulate the growth too much, laying the orchard open not only to unfruitfulness
but to winter injury of bud and tree. Among those who use
fertilizers there is little accord as to what fertilizing compounds are best
or as to what the results have been. There is common agreement, however,
that Sour Cherries respond more generally to fertilizers than the
Sweet sorts. Until there are carefully carried out fertilizer experiments
with this fruit the vexatious problems of fertilization cannot be solved.
Nitrate of soda seems to be a great rejuvenator in orchards laid down to
grass. Whatever the cause, when leaves lack color and hang limp, this
fertilizer is a sovereign tonic. Heavy dressings of stable manure are much
used in grassed-over orchards, as they are, also, in such as have had none
or but scant crops.</p>

<h3>THE COMMERCIAL STATUS OF CHERRY-GROWING IN NEW YORK</h3>

<p>Cherry growing is a specialist's business in which, under the best
of conditions, there are more ups and downs than with other fruits.
Because of the great profits that have come to a few in the years just past
many growers have been drawn into the business in a small way or have
planted an acreage beyond their means to manage. The inevitable depression
that follows over-planting is, at this writing, at hand and spells ruin
to some and disgust and discouragement in the industry to others.
Perhaps no fruit can better be left to men of reserve capital than the
cherry, and even with men of substance cherry-growing should largely
be incidental to the culture of other fruits&mdash;an industry to fit in to keep
land, labor and machinery employed.</p>

<p>Cherry trees begin to bear in the climate of New York when set from
three to five years. The varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> first produce profitable
crops but, at from six to eight years from setting, both Sweet and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Sour sorts are in full swing as money-making crops. The limits of profitable
age are not set by the life of the tree but, rather, by its size. Thus,
cherry trees of either of the species commonly cultivated are not infrequently
centenarians but the profitable age of an orchard is not often
more than from thirty to forty years. After this time the trees become
large and the expense of caring for them and of picking the fruit becomes
so great as to prevent profits. Moreover, disease, injuries and inevitable
accidents will have thinned the ranks of trees until the orchard is below
profit-making.</p>

<p>Cherry-picking begins in New York about the first of July, following
the rush in harvesting strawberries, and lasts, if the orchard contains both
Sweet and Sour varieties, from four to six weeks. Workers may in this
way fill in a gap between small-fruits and other tree-fruits and the crop
becomes one in which the grower may often take small profits to keep
his help employed; though, in the long run, if the more or less frequent
depressions can be weathered, the cherry may prove as profitable as other
fruits.</p>

<p>The problem of labor is a most vexatious one under present conditions,
it being impossible to obtain casual men laborers for cherry-picking and
women and children are unsatisfactory, since the fruit must be carefully
picked or both cherries and trees suffer. The problem is solved, unsatisfactorily
in most cases, in various ways by different growers. Most of
the crop is now picked by children in the teens under the eyes of men
or women supervisors. In picking for the market the stem is left on
and only the stem is touched by the fingers. Cherries for canning
factories are less laboriously picked. The picking package is usually an
eight-pound basket. The rate paid is one cent per pound. Pickers earn
$1.50 to $2.00 per day in good seasons. Close watch is kept on pickers
to prevent the breaking off of fruit-spurs, thereby destroying the succeeding
year's crop, varieties fruiting in clusters suffering especially from carelessness
in this respect. Cherries are picked a few days before full ripeness.</p>

<p>Cherries are sent to canneries in various packages but chiefly in
half-bushel baskets or paper-lined bushel crates, the container being often
supplied by the cannery. The six- and eight-pound baskets are the favored
receptacles for Sour Cherries in city markets but the Sweet sorts are rather
oftener sent in four-pound baskets and still more frequently in quart boxes.
In the larger packages not much effort is made to make the fruit attractive
but in the smaller ones, stemless and bruised cherries are thrown out and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the package filled, stem down, with the best fruits. In fancy grades all
of the fruit in the box is layered. The demands of the market, of course,
determine the package and the manner of packing. Cherries are seldom
stored longer than a few days at most in common storage and a week or
two weeks in cold storage.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference in the shipping and keeping qualities
of varieties of cherries, the sorts that keep longest and ship best, quite
at the expense of quality, having the call of the markets. Undoubtedly
this must remain so, though it is to be desired that local markets, at least,
be supplied with the best, irrespective of handling qualities. A further
factor that prevents the placing of choicely good cherries in distant
markets at all times is brown-rot, to be discussed later, which more often
attacks the juicy and usually the best-flavored varieties, oftentimes ruining
the pack on the way to market&mdash;one of the most discouraging events
incidental to cherry-growing.</p>

<p>Marketing machinery for cherries is at present very costly, inadequate
and frequently sadly out of gear. The fruit passes first from the grower
to a local buyer who ships to a center of consumption, transportation
companies taking heavy toll on the way. Jobbers or commission companies,
who in some cases receive the fruit direct from the grower, then
distribute the crop to retailers in the consuming centers. Lastly, the
retailer parcels out the quantities and the qualities demanded by the
housewife. The whole business of selling the crop is speculative and the
grower is fortunate to receive half of what the consumer pays and not
infrequently has all of his pains for nothing or may even be forced to
dip into his pocket for transportation. The perishableness of the product
and the present defects of distribution go far to make the crop the hazardous
one it is but all look forward to better times coming under an improved
system of marketing.</p>

<p>Up to the present, it must be said, but little effort has been made
in New York to ship far and to develop a trade in cherries other than at
the canneries. The canners have until the last year or two taken the
cream of the crop but with recent greatly increased plantings are now
over-supplied. The average grower, possessing a mixture of mental inertia
and business caution, has not sought other sources for the surplus fruit.
Bolder and more energetic spirits are now developing new markets and
opening up those to which other tree-fruits more generally go so that the
present over-production may prove a blessing in disguise. The greatly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
increased demand, for Sour Cherries in particular, brought about by the
development of markets in 1913-14, are most hopeful signs for the future
of the cherry industry.</p>

<h3>CHERRY DISEASES</h3>

<p>Cherries, without preventive or remedial intervention, are at the mercy
of two or three fungus diseases and sometimes several others are virulent,
depending upon locality, season, weather and variety. One of these
diseases, brown-rot, in spite of the great advances in plant pathology of
recent years, is almost beyond the control of preventive or remedial
measures. Happily, all the others yield better to treatment.</p>

<p>Brown-rot<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sclerotinia fructigena</i> (Persoon) Schroeter), sometimes
known as fruit-mold or ripe-rot, very frequently attacks flowers and shoots
but is most conspicuous on the ripe or ripening cherries where its presence
is quickly detected by a dark discoloration of the skin which is afterwards
partly or wholly covered with pustule-like aggregations of gray spores.
The decayed fruits usually fall to the ground but sometimes hang to the
tree, becoming shriveled mummies, each mummy being a storehouse of
fungus threads and spores from which infestation spreads to the next
crop. The disease, in some seasons, like a withering blight, attacks twigs,
flowers and leaves early in the spring doing great damage to the young
growth and often wholly preventing the setting of fruit. The rot spreads
with surprising rapidity on the fruits in warm, damp weather either before
the fruit is picked or in baskets while being shipped or stored. Preventive
remedies have so far met with but indifferent success; probably the best
method of control is to destroy the mummy-like fruits and all other sources
of infection either by picking them from the trees, or much better by
plowing them under deeply. Varieties of cherries show various degrees
of susceptibility to brown-rot. All Sweet Cherries are more subject to
the disease than the Sour sorts. But with either of the two species there
are great variations in the susceptibility of the varietal hosts&mdash;a matter
specially noted in a later chapter in the discussion of varieties.</p>

<p>Another serious disease of the cherry, and probably the most striking
one in appearance, is the black-knot<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plowrightia morbosa</i> (Schweinitz)
Saccardo), characterized by wart-like excrescences on shoots and branches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Black-knot looks more like the work of an insect than a fungus and was
long supposed to be such even by those who were studying the trouble.
The knots begin to form early in the summer and are of characteristic
color and texture&mdash;dark green, soft and velvety, but in the fall, as the
fungus ripens, the color changes to coal-black and the knots become hard
and more or less brittle. The excrescences usually form on one side of
a twig or branch so that death seldom follows quickly. The disease attacks
both wild and cultivated plants in every part of this continent where
cherries are grown but is epidemic only in the East, the cherry regions
of the West being practically free from the disease. Up to the present
time the fungus has not been found elsewhere than in America. Happily,
black-knot may be controlled by cutting out the diseased wood. To
completely eradicate the fungus, if it is especially virulent, however, the
orchard must be gone over several times during a season. In New York
the removal of black-knot is ordered by law, the results showing that
when the law is obeyed, especially if there be hearty co-operation among
growers, eradication is usually possible. Sweet Cherries are much less
attacked by black-knot than the Sour sorts but the differences in immunity
between varieties in either of the two species are not very marked&mdash;at
least such is the case on the grounds of this Station where the disease
is always present and is often very prevalent.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exoascus cerasi</i> Fuckel<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> is the cause of a very striking deformity of
the cherry in Europe, both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> being
attacked. The disease has been reported in America but has not yet
become virulent. The fungus attacks the branches, causing a clustering
of the twigs in the form of a broom, giving it the name witches' broom.
The leaves on the diseased twigs usually take on a crinkled shape and a
reddish color. The malady may be readily prevented by the destruction
of affected branches.</p>

<p>In common with other species of Prunus the foliage of cherries is
attacked by several fungi which produce diseased spots on the leaves, the
dead areas usually dropping out leaving holes as if punctured by shot.
Thus we have "shot-hole fungus," "leaf-spot" and "leaf-blight" as
effects of these diseases. Three fungi are in the main responsible for these
leaf troubles; these are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cylindrosporium padi</i> Karsten,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mycosphærella</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerasella</i> Aderhold<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cercospora circumscissa</i><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Saccardo. The ravages of
these fungi are prevented by the proper use of bordeaux mixture and lime
and sulphur, remedies which, however, must be used with some care to
avoid spray injury. With these, as with other fungi, cultivation has
a salutary effect as it destroys diseased leaves which harbor the fungi
during their resting period.</p>

<p>Cherry leaves are often covered with a grayish powder which in
severe cases causes them to curl and crinkle and sometimes to drop. This
powdery substance consists of the spore-bearing organs of a mildew<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Podosphæra oxyacanthæ</i> De Bary). Powdery mildew is much more
common on nursery stock than on fruiting trees and in New York is a
serious pest on young cherry trees. In the nursery, injury may be prevented
by the use of copper sprays or lime and sulphur, either of which
is also an efficient preventive in the orchard but the mildew is seldom
prevalent enough on orchard plants to require treatment.</p>

<p>Wherever cherries are grown in either the nursery or orchard, crown
gall<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacterium tumefaciens</i> Smith and Townsend) has obtained a footing.
In the North at least, it seldom greatly injures old trees, but if the galls
girdle a nursery plant serious injury results. Therefore, badly infected
young trees showing galls should not be planted. However, but little
harm is liable to result under most conditions. When infected plants
have been planted it has been found that galls vary greatly in duration,
sometimes disappearing within a year or two and at other times persisting
indefinitely. The tumor-like structures are usually at the collar of the
plant and vary from the size of a pea to that of a man's fist, forming at
maturity rough, knotty, dark-colored masses. Neither prevention nor
cure has been discovered, though it is known that soils may be inoculated
with the disease from infected stock and that, therefore, diseased trees
should not be planted in soils virgin to the galls. It is probable that there
are differences in the susceptibility of Sweet and Sour cherries to the
fungus and that the varieties of the two species vary in their resistance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
but as yet no one seems to have reported on the differences in susceptibility
of cherries to the disease.</p>

<p>The leaf-rust<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puccinia pruni-spinosæ</i> Persoon) of stone-fruits, occurring
rarely on the fruit, sometimes attacks cultivated cherries and is a rather
common disease of the wild <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus serotina</i>. This rust is troublesome only,
however, in warm, moist climates. It is most apparent in the fall and is
easily recognized through its numerous rust-colored sori on the underside
of the leaves. Defoliation takes place in severe infestations. Either bordeaux
mixture or lime and sulphur may be used as a preventive.</p>

<p>Old cherry trees are often attacked by a fleshy fungus or "toadstool"<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyporus sulphureus</i> (Bulliard) Fries). This fungus is said to be world-wide
in its distribution and to occur upon a large variety of trees. It is
very striking in appearance, the clusters appearing during late summer
or early autumn in large, shelving branches, the sporophores fleshy and of
cheese-like consistency when young but becoming hard and woody with
age. At first the "toadstools" are all yellow but later only the under
surfaces are yellow while the upper surface is orange-red. The plants
are more or less odoriferous, the odor increasing with age. Happily, the
fungus is not very virulent but is often the cause of decay in the tree-trunk&mdash;the
brown-rot of the wood of this and other orchard and forest plants.
In localities where the fungus thrives it may usually be controlled by
covering all wounds with tar or other antiseptic materials.</p>

<p>At least two other fleshy fungi have been found injuring cherries.
These are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clitocybe parasitica</i> Wilcox<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armillaria mellea</i> Vahl.,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> the
latter the honey agaric, more or less abundant in both Europe and America.
Both are associated with and are probably a cause of the root-rot of the
cherry and other orchard fruits. Neither is a common enough pest in
this country, however, to receive extensive description in texts on diseases
of plants. Control measures are different in localities where fungi occur,
consisting in the main of getting rid of stumps and roots in orchard lands
and planting to field crops before using for orchard purposes. Infected
trees should be removed or isolated by trenching about them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>All stone-fruits suffer more or less from an excessive flow of gum.
The name gummosis<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> is generally applied to these troubles. Gumming
is much more prevalent in the far West than in the East but is to be
found wherever stone-fruits are grown. This excessive gumming is a
secondary effect of injuries caused by fungi, bacteria, insects, frost, sunscald,
and mechanical agencies. There is a good deal of difference in the
susceptibilities of varieties and species to this trouble, the Sweet Cherry
suffering much more than the Sour sorts and varieties of other species
having hard wood suffering less than those having softer wood. There is
less gummosis, too, on trees in soils favoring the maturity of wood; under
conditions where sun and frost are not injurious; and, obviously, in
orchards where by good care the primary causes of the diseases are kept
out.</p>

<p>A number of diseases of the trunk arise from mechanical injuries
from wind, sun, frost and hail. Few, indeed, are the fruit-growers whose
trees are not occasionally damaged in one way or another in the vicissitudes
of a trying climate. Very often these mechanical injuries are followed
by fungal parasites or insects so as to make it difficult to distinguish the
primary from the secondary trouble. There is a wide difference in the
susceptibility of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i> to such injuries, the
Sweet Cherry, with its softer wood, being much more easily injured by
any and all stresses of weather than the Sour Cherry. In the main the
elements cannot be combated but low heading of the trees is a preventive
from sunscald, at least, and sometimes may have a favorable effect in
preventing wind and frost injuries.</p>

<h3>CHERRY INSECTS</h3>

<p>Insects troubling cherries are numerous but hardly as destructive as
with other tree-fruits. Entomologists list about 40 species of insects
attacking cherries and about as many more occasionally attack the varieties
of one or the other of the two cultivated species. The majority of
these pests came with the tree from its habitat over the sea but several
have come from the wild cherries of this continent.</p>

<p>Of the pests peculiar to the cherry alone, possibly the cherry fruit
maggot<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhagoletis cingulata</i> Loew) is, the country over, as troublesome
as any. The adult insect is a small fly with barred wings which lays eggs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
under the skin of the cherry in mid-summer. From these eggs small,
whitish maggots about one-third of an inch long hatch and eat out a cavity
in the ripening fruit. These maggots when full grown pupate in the ground
and remain there until the following season. The only effective preventive
or remedial measure to take against the pest in large orchards is
to spray with a sweetened arsenical, but in small plantations chickens are
fairly effective in scratching up and eating the pupating maggots.</p>

<p>The cherry fruit maggot is probably responsible for most of the
"wormy" cherries in New York but the plum curculio is also a cause of
"wormy" fruits and in some seasons is a most formidable pest. This
curculio<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conotrachelus nenuphar</i> Herbst) is a rough, grayish snout-beetle
somewhat less than a quarter of an inch in length, so familiar an insect
as scarcely to need further description. The female beetle pierces the
skin of the young cherries and places an egg in the puncture. About
this cavity she gouges out a crescent-shaped trench, this cut or sting being
a most discouraging sign to the cherry-grower, for he well knows that
from the eggs come, within a week or two, white and footless grubs which
burrow to the stone and make "wormy fruit." Some of the infested
cherries drop but many remain eventually to distract the housewife and
those who eat cherries out of hand. Jarring the beetles from the trees,
a method employed by plum-growers, is quite too expensive and ineffective
for the cherry-grower and poisoning with an arsenate is the only practical
means of combating the pest. Rubbish and vegetation offer hiding places
for the insects and, therefore, cultivated orchards are freer from curculio
than those laid down to grass. There are no curculio-proof cherries but,
as with plums, the thin-skinned varieties are damaged most by the insect.</p>

<p>The grub of the plum curculio is easily distinguished from the cherry
fruit maggot. This "worm" is the larva of a beetle, a true grub, footless
and with a brownish, horny head while the cherry fruit maggot, the larva
of a two-winged insect, is a true maggot like that which comes from the
common house-fly and hardly to be distinguished from the apple maggot.
It is important to be able to distinguish in wormy cherries the grub of
the curculio from the cherry fruit maggot in order to know and understand
the nature of the two enemies in combating them.</p>

<p>Another pest of this fruit is the cherry leaf-beetle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galerucella cavicollis</i>
Le Conte) the larvae of which sometimes do much damage to cherry
foliage. The adult insect is an oval, reddish beetle about one-fourth of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
an inch long with black legs and antennae. Both the adult and the larvae
feed on the leaves and do much damage if abundant. Usually there are
two broods, the insect pupating in the ground. Fortunately the pest is
easily controlled with the arsenical sprays.</p>

<p>The cherry scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus forbesi</i> Johnson) is commonly found on
this fruit and occasionally on others as well. To the unaided eye it is
very similar to the well-known San José scale, differing chiefly in being
lighter in color. The remedy is the same as for the San José scale, which
we next discuss.</p>

<p>The dreaded San José scale<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus perniciosus</i> Comstock) is
rather less harmful to cherries than to other tree-fruits and yet is sometimes
a serious pest on Sweet Cherries. Sour Cherries are almost immune.
The insect is now so well known in all fruit-growing regions that it needs
no description. It is usually first recognized by its work, evidence of its
presence being dead or dying twigs&mdash;oftentimes the whole tree is moribund.
Examination shows the twigs or trees to be covered with myriads
of minute scales, the size of a small pin-head, which give the infested bark
a scurfy, ashy look. If the bark be cut or scraped a reddish discoloration
is found. Leaves and fruit as well as bark are infested, the insidious pest,
however, usually first gaining a foothold on the trunks or a large branch.
Cherry-growers, in common with all fruit-growers, find the lime and sulphur
solution the most effective spray in combating this insect.</p>

<p>Several other scale insects feed on the cherries and, now and then,
become pestiferous; among these the following may be named: The
European fruit lecanium<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lecanium corni</i> Bouché) occasionally does a
great deal of damage in New York and now and then destroys the whole
crop in an orchard. The winter treatment for San José scale is used to
control this pest, but usually such treatment is supplemented by a summer
spray about July first with such contact sprays as whale oil soap and
kerosene emulsion. The fruit pulvinaria (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvinaria amygdali</i> Cockerell),
the mealy bug (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pseudococcus longispinus</i> Targioni), the scurfy scale
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chionaspis furfura</i> Fitch), the West Indian peach scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aulacaspis pentagona</i>
Targioni), the Putnam scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus ancylus</i> Putnam), the
walnut scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus juglans-regiæ</i> Comstock), Howard's scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus
howardii</i> Cockerell), the European fruit scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspidiotus ostreæformis</i>
Curtis), the red scale of California (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysomphalus aurantii</i> Maskell), the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
oyster-shell scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidosaphes ulmi</i> Linnaeus), and the soft scale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coccus
hesperidum</i> Linnaeus), are all more or less common.</p>

<p>Several borers occasionally infest cherry trees of which the peach
borer<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanninoidea exitiosa</i> Say.) is the most troublesome. Larvae of the
peach borer are frequently found in both Sweet and Sour Cherries, more
particularly in Sweet Cherries, in eastern orchards. Fortunately this
pest is not as rife with the cherry as with peaches and plums. Its work
may be prevented by thorough cultivation, by mounding the trees and,
according to some, by the use of a covering of tar or of obnoxious or
poisonous washes. Usually preventive measures are not effective, however,
and the borer must be destroyed&mdash;best done by digging it out with a knife
and wire. Since the pest is easily discovered through the exudation of
gum mixed with sawdust or excreta, close to the surface or just beneath
the ground, its presence can be detected in time to prevent its doing much
damage. The lesser peach borer<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sesia pictipes</i> Grote &amp; Robinson) often
attacks old or weakened cherry trees, working in the growing tissues of
the trunk anywhere from the ground to the main branches. The worm
is much like the common peach borer, known by all, but is smaller, rarely
reaching the length of four-fifths of an inch when full grown. The flat-headed
apple tree borer<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysobothris femorata</i> Fabricius) is a common
pest in wild cherries and sometimes seriously attacks the cultivated species.
It is treated as is the peach borer.</p>

<p>The shot-hole borer<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eccoptogaster rugulosus</i> Ratzeburg), though
seldom injuring healthy trees, is very often a serious menace in old or
decrepit cherry trees. It may be looked upon, however, as an effect
rather than a cause. The peach bark-beetle<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phlæotribus liminaris</i>
Harris) is very similar in its work to the shot-hole borer and like it attacks
only diseased and decrepit trees.</p>

<p>All cherry-growers are familiar with the small, dark green, slimy slugs
which feed on the surface of the leaves of the cherry, possibly more common
on the foliage of pears, eating out the soft tissues and leaving but
the skeleton of the leaf. If the slugs are numerous the tree may be
defoliated or if the leaves remain the foliage looks as if scorched. The
adult of this slug is a sawfly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caliroa</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eriocampoides</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerasi</i> Linnaeus)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
which lays its eggs within the tissue of the leaves. Despite the fact that
it is easily destroyed by any of the arsenical sprays or by dusting with
lime this slug everywhere does much damage to cherries.</p>

<p>Wild cherries suffer severely from the tent caterpillar<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malacosoma
americana</i> Fabricius) and occasionally cultivated trees are attacked. The
arsenical sprays are fatal to the pest. The spring canker-worm<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paleacrita
vernata</i> Peck) and the fall canker-worm<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alsophila pometaria</i> Harris),
the white-marked tussock moth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemerocampa leucostigma</i> Smith and
Abbot), the rusty tussock moth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemerocampa antiqua</i> Linnaeus), and
the definite-marked tussock moth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemerocampa definita</i> Packard) are all
occasional cherry pests and all succumb to poisonous sprays. The two
now notorious European pests recently introduced into America, gypsy
moth (<cite>Porthetria dispar</cite> Linnaeus) and the browntail moth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euproctis
chrysorrhæa</i> Linnaeus), attack cherry trees in common with other deciduous
trees and may often do considerable damage. Sometimes, but not often,
the buds of the cherry are attacked by the bud-moth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spilonota</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tmetocera</i>)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ocellana</i> Schiffermüller), the caterpillars of which bind the young leaves
together as they expand so that small, dead, brown clusters of foliage
are to be seen here and there where the pests are at work. Spraying with
arsenicals is effective if done just as the buds begin to open.</p>

<p>In sandy soils the cherry is sometimes attacked by hordes of the
common rose-chafer (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macrodactylus subspinosus</i> Fabricius), leaves, flowers
and even the fruit suffering from the pest. It is a difficult insect to control
but a spray of arsenate of lead with molasses is fairly effective. It is
important to know that the insect does not often breed in ground kept
in clean cultivation.

<p>Abbesse d'Oignies has so many good characters that it is well worth
trying commercially wherever cherries are grown in the United States.
Curiously enough, it seems so far to have been tried only in the Middle
West, Professor Budd having introduced it in Iowa from Russia in 1883.
In the unfavorable soil and climatic conditions of the Mississippi
Valley, Abbesse d'Oignies grows as well as any cherry of its class, if we
may judge from the accounts of it. We do not know of its having been
tried elsewhere in the East than on our grounds and here we find it, in
competition with practically all of the varieties of its class, one of the
best of the Dukes. At this Station it does so well that we described it,
in the reference given, as one of the noteworthy fruits in our collection.
The trees are large, vigorous, hardy, fruitful and very free from fungus
diseases. The cherries are large, dark red, of most excellent quality,
combining the flavor of the Dukes with a firmer and yet tenderer flesh
than the Montmorency. The high quality, handsome appearance and
good shipping qualities of the fruit, combined with the splendid characters
of the tree, ought to make Abbesse d'Oignies a very good commercial
variety.</p>

<p>This cherry probably originated in Belgium about the middle of the
Nineteenth Century. At least it was first listed in Belgian nursery catalogs
in 1854. It is now a greater or less favorite wherever cherries are
grown in the Old World, Professor Budd having found it, as we have said,
in 1883, in Russia and immediately transported it to America.</p>

<p>Parkinson, nearly three hundred years ago, thought the Arch Duke
"one of the fairest and best of cherries." It is now, however, quite surpassed
by several others of the Dukes. The concensus of opinion of those
who have known the true fruit of this name is that either May Duke or
Late Duke is better. We give it prominence only because of its worthy
past and that it may be better distinguished from May Duke with which
it is often confused. As compared with the last-named variety it is two
weeks later; the tree is more vigorous but not as productive; and the branches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
are larger, more divergent and more pendulous. The cherries are not as
well flavored but are larger and have a shorter stalk.</p>

<p>This old English variety was first mentioned by Parkinson in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paradisus
Terrestris</i>, 1629. For many years previous to the middle of the last century
the true Arch Duke cherry was very scarce and was often confused with
other varieties, some writers asserting that it was the May Duke; others,
the Late Duke. In 1847, however, the true Arch Duke cherry was discovered
in the nurseries of Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England,
having been grown there, according to Mr. Rivers, by his ancestors for
nearly a century. It was then found that the fruit was quite unlike that
of either May Duke or Late Duke, though the habit of the tree was similar.
It is not known when Arch Duke was introduced into America but the
American Pomological Society placed it upon its fruit list in 1871.</p>

<p>Baldwin is supposed to have grown from a sprout of a stock on which
Early Richmond had been budded on the farm of S. J. Baldwin, Seneca,
Kansas. The Early Richmond bud was in some manner broken off and
the sprout, springing from the stock, was allowed to grow and first fruited
in 1891. On the grounds of this Station Baldwin trees which came fairly
direct from the originator turned out to be Olivet. The published
descriptions that can be found are so scant and fragmentary that we cannot
make out whether the variety is really distinct or, as in the case of our
trees, is Olivet renamed. The variety has been rather widely disseminated
in the Middle West but has not shown much merit either for home or for
commercial orchards in the rather lengthy probationary period it has had
in the East. The American Pomological Society added Baldwin to its
fruit list in 1909. The description we give is a compilation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree vigorous, upright, round-topped; leaves large, broad; flowers white, changing
to pink.</p>

<p>Fruit ripens early; usually borne in pairs; large, round; stem of medium length, rather
thick; color very dark red, yet almost transparent; flavor slightly acid, yet considered
one of the sweetest and richest of the Morello class.</p></blockquote>

<p>Baumann May is an early Sweet Cherry which at one time held high
place among its kind but a century of culture proved that it had little
value except for extreme earliness and it is now but sparingly or not at
all grown either in America or abroad. If the variety could be obtained it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
might be worth growing for breeding work because of its earliness and
great productiveness. At one time this variety was rather largely grown
in central and western New York and specimens of it must yet remain in
this region.</p>

<p>From the latter part of the Eighteenth Century, when we first find
an account of this variety in Kraft's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pomona Austriaca</i>, to the last of the
Nineteenth, writers have described Baumann May under many different
names. From all accounts it originated toward the latter part of the
Eighteenth Century, in Germany. From Germany it was introduced into
Alsace where F. J. Baumann, a nurseryman at Bollweiler, grew it in his
nursery under the name Bigarreau Baumann and disseminated it throughout
the French provinces. The cherry was received in America, with
several others, by Colonel M. P. Wilder of Boston, Massachusetts, from
Messrs. Baumann, about the year 1838. The American Pomological
Society listed the variety, in 1862, in its fruit catalog as Bauman's May
but dropped it again in 1871. The following description is a compilation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree vigorous, somewhat spreading, regular in form, compact, very productive;
branches stocky, nearly horizontal but often curved downward; branchlets with short
internodes, reddish-brown nearly covered with silver-gray scarf-skin; leaves medium to
large, dark green, ovate-oblong, coarsely and deeply serrate; petiole rather short, with
two large, reniform glands near the base of the leaf; buds large, ovate; flowers of medium
size, opening very early.</p>

<p>Fruit matures very early; medium to rather small, ovate-cordate, angular, irregular
in outline; color dark red becoming nearly black when fully ripe; stem one and three-quarters
inches long, rather thick; flesh purplish-red, with abundant juice, soft and tender,
sweet, well flavored; of good quality; stone medium in size, roundish-ovate.</p></blockquote>

<p>By general consent Bessarabian has a place in home orchards in the
colder parts of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains. It is very
hardy and is said to thrive even under neglect&mdash;standing as much abuse
as a forest tree. As compared with standard commercial cherries of the
East the fruit is distinctly inferior in size and quality, being hardly fit to
eat out of hand, and is sour and astringent even when cooked. The trees,
though hardy and healthy, are dwarfish and not productive because of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
smallness of the cherries. It is an early cherry but the fruit hangs long.
The variety is said to root well from cuttings, which, if true, might make
it worth while trying as a stock. Bessarabian is a variant of English
Morello, the fruit of which sort greatly excels it wherever the trees can
be equally well grown.</p>

<p>This variety was brought to America from Russia about 1883, by
Professor J. L. Budd of Ames, Iowa, who believed it to belong to a race
of cherries originally found in central Asia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree of medium size, upright, becoming somewhat spreading, compact, healthy,
unproductive, very hardy; branches somewhat drooping, long, slender; leaves abundant,
medium to small, oval, coarsely serrate, dark green, broad, flat; glands few, usually on
the stalk at the base of the leaf.</p>

<p>Fruit matures medium early, remaining on the tree a long time in good condition;
medium in size, roundish-oblate to cordate, irregular, bright red becoming dark red;
stem long, varying from one and three-fourths to two inches in length, slender, curved;
skin tender; flesh light to dark red, with abundant colored juice, variable in firmness,
sprightly subacid becoming milder when fully ripe; fair in quality; stone variable in
size, roundish-oval, semi-clinging.</p></blockquote>

<p>This variety originated in France as a chance seedling about 1883 and
fruited first in 1891. It was introduced a few years later by M. Auguste
Pélissier, a nurseryman at Château-Renard, Bouches-du-Rhône, France.
Although not yet well established even in France, this cherry is considered
promising for market, because of its firm flesh, handsome appearance,
high quality and good tree-characters. It is included among the major
varieties in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> that the attention of American
cherry-growers may be called to it. As yet it seems not to have been tried
in this country. The following description is compiled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree upright, vigorous, very productive; branches rather long, large, bearing large,
oval leaves; flowers large, semi-open; blooming season early.</p>

<p>Fruit matures from early June to the last of June; large or very large, obtuse-cordate,
slightly depressed at the apex, with a shallow yet distinct suture; stem short, thick; skin
rather thick, firm, yellowish almost entirely overspread with vivid red which becomes
darker at maturity but often showing streaks of clear red; flesh fine-grained, firm, juicy,
red with streaks of white, sweet, aromatic; quality good to very good; stone of medium
size, oval, with a pronounced suture.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bing is one of the best of the several very good cherries from the Pacific
Northwest. But few Sweet Cherries equal it in size and attractiveness
and none surpass it in quality, so that it may be said to be as good as any
of the dessert cherries. It is, too, a very good shipping fruit, ranking with
the best of the Bigarreaus, to which group it belongs, as a cherry for distant
markets. Another quality commending the variety is that it hangs well on
the trees and the crop ripens at one time so that the harvest consists of but
one picking. While many cherry-growers speak well of the trees, unfortunately
we cannot do so from their behavior on the grounds of this Station.
They have not been as vigorous, as healthy or as productive as cherry trees
should be in a commercial variety of first rank. The cause, however, may
be in the location rather than in the variety, for in an orchard but a few
miles distant Bing does much better than on these grounds. The variety,
though comparatively new, is no longer on probation. It has a niche in
the cherry flora of the country, deserving a place in the collection of every
amateur by virtue of its splendid fruit. When it is happy in soil and
climate, Bing is bound to be one of the leading commercial cherries.</p>

<p>Seth Lewelling of Milwaukee, Oregon, the originator of several of our
finest cherries, grew Bing from the seed of Republican in 1875. The variety
was named after a Chinese workman. In 1899 the American Pomological
Society placed the variety on its fruit list.</p>

<p>There is much confusion in the history of this old cherry. It
undoubtedly originated in France and in that part of the country later conquered
by the Germans, though Mas, in his <cite>Pomologie Générale</cite>, mentioned
it as probably of German origin. In the time of Louis XIII this variety
was known as the Guigne Noire Commune and was cultivated quite
extensively in France and northern Italy. It was esteemed both for its
earliness and its fine quality and was known as Guigne Guindoulle by the
peasants of central France and by the Tuscans in Italy as Corbini because
of the color of its skin. Black Guigne, Black Heart, and Early Purple,
which, while similar in many characters, are entirely distinct, have been
badly confused by both French and German writers and it is only with
the greatest difficulty that the three can be separated. While this cherry
was formerly considered of worth in Continental Europe, it is scarcely
recognized there now and was probably never brought to America. The
following description is compiled from European fruit-books:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree very large, round-topped, spreading, irregular in outline, productive; branches
long, large, straight, brownish, mottled with gray scarf-skin; internodes long and unequal;
leaves large, oval or oblong, acuminate; margin irregularly serrate; petiole long, slender,
with large glands; blooming season late; flowers small.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the last of June to the middle of July, usually attached in pairs but
sometimes in threes; medium to large in size, obtuse-cordate; color bright reddish-black
changing to deep purple; suture indistinct; stem slender, inserted in a deep, broad cavity;
skin thin, tender; flesh dark purple, with abundant colored juice, half-tender, somewhat
stringy, sweet yet sprightly, pleasantly flavored; quality good; stone small, oval.</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that Black Hawk was lauded by the horticulturists
in the middle of the last century as one of the best of all black Sweet
Cherries, it is now almost unknown. According to the older pomologists
it was unsurpassed for eating out of hand but was only mediocre in all other
characters of either fruit or tree. In particular it was surpassed in many
ways by the better-known Eagle which fills about the same place in cherry
culture. The variety was very popular in southern Ohio about Cincinnati
where many trees may still be found and where it is still more or less planted.
Possibly because of the excellent quality of the fruit, the amateur might
well try a tree or two. The description is compiled.</p>

<p>Black Hawk originated with Professor J. P. Kirtland of Cleveland,
Ohio, sometime previous to 1845. It is one of the best of the many seedlings
fruited by him. The American Pomological Society in 1854 named
this sort as one of the promising new fruits and it still remains on the fruit-list
of this organization.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, vigorous, spreading, round-topped, resembling Yellow Spanish in habit,
productive, healthy; branches stout, smooth, dark reddish-brown, straight; branchlets
slender, with short internodes.</p>

<p>Leaves large, folded upward, obovate, rather thick; upper surface dark green; lower
surface pale green; apex abruptly pointed; margin coarsely and deeply serrate; petiole
short, stout, bright red, with two or more orange-red, reniform glands.</p>

<p>Buds of medium size, rather short, free; flowers small or medium in size; pedicels
long, very slender; calyx-lobes straight, finely serrate, obtuse; petals roundish, broadly
and deeply notched at the tip.</p>

<p>Fruit matures about the middle of June, a few days later than Black Tartarian;
medium to large, obtuse-cordate, surface uneven, sides compressed; cavity deep, broad,
abrupt, nearly regular; color glossy, dark purplish-black changing to almost black at complete
maturity; stem usually thick but often variable, of medium length; skin thick,
adhering to the pulp; flesh purplish-black, tender, with abundant colored juice, aromatic,
well flavored, sweet; of very good quality; stone of medium size, with uneven surfaces.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although one of the oldest cherries under cultivation, Black Heart is
still largely grown the world over. Prince, in 1832, said that it was more
widely cultivated in the United States than any other variety and Downing,
in 1845, said Black Heart was then better known than any other cherry
in the country. While neither of these two statements would hold for
Black Heart now, it having long since passed its heyday of popularity, it
is still, because of the fruitfulness of the tree and the high quality and
beauty of the fruit, a variety of much merit. Black Heart fails in the
commercial fruit growing of nowadays, as compared with the cherry culture
of the fruit connoisseurs of a generation ago, because it does not meet
market demands, failing to do so through two defects: it does not ship
well and when brown-rot is rife it quickly succumbs to this fungus. It is,
too, now difficult to obtain the variety true to name, the trees at this Station,
as an example, in several attempts, turning out untrue, which forces
the use of a compiled description in this text.</p>

<p>This cherry was mentioned by John Rea in 1676 but there can be no
doubt but that it originated many years previous to this date. Probably
it is the cherry mentioned by Robert Dodonée, a naturalist of Malines,
Belgium, in 1552. When or by whom it was introduced to America is not
known but it was being grown here very early in the Nineteenth Century
and ever since has been considered a valuable variety for general planting.
Nearly every nurseryman throughout the United States lists Black Heart,
a fact attesting its popularity. The American Pomological Society placed
Black Heart on its catalog of fruits in 1862, a place which it has since
retained.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, very vigorous, tall, wide-spreading, productive; branches stout, brownish,
mingled with yellow, mottled with gray scarf-skin; lenticels numerous, small.</p>

<p>Black Tartarian is probably the favorite dooryard and roadside Sweet
Cherry in New York and ranks second or third among commercial cherries
in the State, as it probably does for the whole region east of the Mississippi.
It is known by all who grow or eat cherries. The preeminently meritorious
characters which give it so high a place in cherry culture are: first, and
most important, the elasticity of its constitution whereby it adapts itself
to widely different soils and climates; second, the fruitfulness, healthfulness
and robustness of the trees which also bear regularly, live to an old age
and grow to a prodigious size, oftentimes attaining a diameter of two feet;
third, this variety is comparatively free from the worst of cherry diseases,
brown-rot; lastly, the cherries, though not as large as some similar sorts,
are tempting to the eye through their rotund form and glossy black color
and are a delight to the palate, the handsome purplish-red flesh being firm
and crisp, yet juicy, with a sweet, rich flavor which all agree gives the quality
the rank of "very good to best." It is a virile variety and from it have
come several promising seedlings and it is one of the parents of a number
of cross-bred cherries. Black Tartarian is earlier than most of the Sweet
Cherries with which it must compete&mdash;under most conditions a help in
marketing. Unfortunately it is a little too soft to handle well in harvesting
and marketing or to hold its shape as a canned product. Its small size
is also against it for the canner's trade. The several defects noted prevent
Black Tartarian from taking first rank in commercial orchards but for the
home plantation it is one of the best.</p>

<p>Black Tartarian came originally from Russia. It was introduced into
England in 1794 from Circassia, by Hugh Ronalds of Brentford, Middlesex,
as Ronald's Large Black Heart. Two years later, John Fraser introduced
a variety, a native of Crimea, which he purchased in St. Petersburg, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Fraser's Black Tartarian. This turned out to be the same as the cherry
from Circassia. Some go farther back and say that Black Tartarian was
carried to Russia from Spain, thence to England. It owes its introduction
into this country to William Prince of Flushing, Long Island, probably
in the early part of the Nineteenth Century. It was recognized in 1848
and placed on the schedule of fruits at the National Convention of Fruit
Growers which later became the present American Pomological Society.
The variety still retains a place among the recommended cherries but
under the name Tartarian. The variety quickly became popular in America,
finding a place in every orchard and in the lists of all nurserymen. Some
nurserymen claim to have superior strains of the old variety; as, Green's
Tartarian and Black Tartarian Improved. Comparisons show no differences.
Black Russian, listed by some firms, is probably Black Tartarian
as it is used many times as a synonym by foreign writers.</p>

<p>Bleeding Heart goes back almost as far as the history of cultivated
cherries. It is only of historical interest now and this chiefly because it
has been the parent of many sorts of present worth. According to the old
writers it took highest rank in the cherry lists of a century and more ago
by virtue of its high quality and handsome appearance, the name being
indicative of color and form. So far as can be made out at this late date
the variety has been grown but little or not at all in America, the description
here given coming from old pomologies.</p>

<p>This, like the preceding sort, is a cherry of several names, having been
mentioned first by Parkinson in 1629 as the Gascoign Cherry. In England
three different names have been applied to this variety, Gascoigne, Red
Heart and Bleeding Heart. At least there seems to be little doubt that
the Bleeding Heart and Red Heart listed by John Rea in 1676 were the
Gascoign of Parkinson and Gerarde.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree of largest size, very vigorous, not very productive; branches numerous, large,
long, diverging, brownish-red, mottled with gray scarf-skin; leaves very large, oblong,
acuminate; margin crenate; petiole thick, long, reddish, with well-developed glands; blooming
season early.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the latter half of July; usually in pairs, large, elongated heart-shaped,
with pointed apex; color bright red changing to dark red, somewhat mottled; stem two
inches long, slender; flesh reddish, rather tender although firm, with abundant juice, highly
flavored, sweetish; good in quality; stone large, oblong.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bourgueil is a variant form of Montmorency hardly differing enough
in fruit from Large Montmorency to be distinguished from it and yet
since it seems to be more productive than the last-named sort it is possibly
worth adding to the cherry flora of the country. The variety, it must be
remembered, is still on probation, but if trees true to name can be obtained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
it is worth planting in small numbers where growers want a cherry of the
Montmorency type.</p>

<p>This variety was found by a Doctor Bretonneau about 1844 in Bourgueil,
Indre-et-Loire, France. It is known by the name of the finder as
well as that of the locality in which it originated and through having the
same place of origin is often confused with Cerise Rouge Pale. The United
States Department of Agriculture received this variety in 1905 from Ferdinand
Jamin, Bourg-la-Reine, Seine, France, and in turn forwarded it to
this Station where it has been fruiting for the past few seasons. Nurserymen
do not as yet offer it for sale and it is doubtful if it is known in more
than a few places in America.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of commercial cherry culture, Brusseler Braune
has little value. The trees are uncertain in bearing; the cherries are small,
sour, and astringent; and, worse than the faults named, the crop ripens
very unevenly. It is of the English Morello type but in New York, at
least, is far inferior to this well-known sort. Brusseler Braune has been
much advertised for cold climates but there are many better cherries that
stand cold nearly or quite as well and are better in both tree and fruit
characters and, in particular, that will not vex the souls of growers by ripening
so unevenly. The variety has two marked peculiarities: the leaves on the
two-year-old wood are very small and the fruit-stems bear a small leaflet
at their base. These leaflets on the fruit-stem would have to be removed
in marketing the crop&mdash;another serious defect.</p>

<p>No doubt Brusseler Braune originated in Holland but there is nothing
definite as to the time though Truchsess, a German, writes of having
received it in 1785 as Brüsselsche Bruyn. The synonyms of this variety
are more or less confused with those of English Morello. This cherry was
brought to America in 1883 by the late J. L. Budd with several other
varieties. In the collection of trees sent out from the original importation,
of which this was one, or from trees budded from them, were Griotte du
Nord, Large Long Late, Shadow Amarelle, Lutovka, George Glass, Orel
No. 27, or Gibb, and Bessarabian. Unfortunately the varieties were badly
mixed and much confusion has resulted. It is not impossible that the
first three are synonyms but the Lutovka, George Glass, Bessarabian and
possibly the Gibb are distinct varieties. In 1895, this Station recommended
a new cherry for trial for home and market and distributed buds throughout
the state under the name Lutovka. Later it was found that an error had
been made regarding the trees sent us as Lutovka, they being the Brusseler
Braune. The American Pomological Society added Brusseler Braune
to its fruit catalog list in 1899 but dropped it in 1909.</p>

<p>So far Bunte Amarelle has found a place only in the trying cherry
climate of Iowa and neighboring States. It is not attractive enough in
appearance, good enough in quality, or certain and fruitful enough in bearing
to compete with other Amarelles, to which group this variety belongs.
Its saving grace is extreme hardiness of tree, though vigor and health help
make it somewhat desirable in cold, prairie regions of the Mid-West where
cherry growing is more or less precarious. There has been much uncertainty
as to the true variety and we have had to discard the trees on the
Station grounds and compile a description.</p>

<p>This variety probably originated in Germany in the latter part of the
Eighteenth Century. Truchsess, a German, in 1819, called the cherry
Bunte Amarelle because of its variegated color before full maturity. The
variety was introduced from Poland to America sometime previous to 1885
and has usually gone under the name of Amarelle Bunte. From all accounts
Professor J. L. Budd of Ames, Iowa, the authority on these hardy cherries
during his time, had two different cherries under the name Amarelle Bunte;
for in his report at the Iowa Horticultural Society in 1885, he mentioned
a variety under that name as being a large, dark purple and nearly sweet
sort which could not have been the true Bunte Amarelle of Truchsess.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Budd and Hansen in 1903 described a variety which agrees very closely
with the true variety of Truchsess which we herewith describe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree vigorous, upright, hardy; foliage large, coarse.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the second week in June; medium to large, roundish, flattened at the
base; cavity variable in depth; suture shallow, indistinct; apex depressed; color yellow
overspread with light red; stem green, straight, rather slender, one and one-half to two
inches long; flesh slightly colored, juicy, firm but tender, pleasantly subacid; very good
in quality; stone variable in size, broad.</p></blockquote>

<p>California Advance is a Sweet Cherry, one of the "Hearts" of common
parlance, distinguished and worth growing only because it is extra early,
though when fully ripe it is of very good quality. It is usually described
as a cherry of "large size" but on the grounds of this Station the cherries
run small, as they are occasionally reported elsewhere to do, suggesting
that the variety requires good care and a choice cherry soil for a finely
finished product. On these grounds the variety seems to be preeminently
free from fungus diseases but the robin and other birds take greater toll
from it than from almost any other cherry, beginning their harvest long
before the fruit is fit for human fare. California Advance might well be
planted in a small way for a local market in New York, or a tree or two
for home use, but it has no place in large numbers in this State.</p>

<p>California Advance came from a seed of Early Purple sown by W. H.
Chapman of Napa, California, the seedling being saved because the cherries
were larger and ripened earlier than those of its parent. It has sometimes
been confused with the Chapman cherry, of somewhat similar characteristics,
which also originated in Napa, but the two are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Carnation is a conspicuous cherry because of its beautiful color&mdash;red,
a little variegated with white or yellow, hence the name. It is one of the
Amarelles, similar to Montmorency except in color in which character it
is more pleasing than the better-known sort. The stone separates from
the pulp very readily leaving the flesh unusually bright and clean. Because
of their sprightly refreshing flavor, the cherries are pleasing to the palate,
as well as attractive to the eye. Unfortunately the trees are but
moderately vigorous and fruitful and these qualities count so heavily
against it as a commercial cherry that Carnation cannot be more than
a fruit for amateurs unless under exceptional conditions. For a home
plantation, however, it would be hard to name a better cherry of its kind.</p>

<p>Carnation is another of the choicely good, old cherries, being first
mentioned by John Rea in 1676 and later by Langley in 1729. Having
been cultivated for so long and disseminated among so many growers who
kept meagre records in early days, this sort became badly confused with
other varieties, especially with the "Cerisier à gros fruit rouge-pale," mentioned
by Duhamel in 1768. How old the variety truly is or where it
originated cannot be said. Carnation seems to have been first mentioned
in America by William Coxe in 1817 and a few years later it was growing
on the grounds of William Prince, Flushing, New York. Since that time
it has been quite widely disseminated throughout the United States but is
grown less extensively now than formerly. The American Pomological
Society, in 1862, placed Carnation on its list of recommended fruits where
it still holds a place.

<p>In California, Centennial is passing from the period of probation to
one of general acceptance as a standard variety. Unfortunately it has not
been well tested in the East but trees growing in a commercial orchard at
Geneva show the variety to be a close competitor, in this instance at least,
with its parent, Napoleon, the mainstay of Sweet Cherry growers in New
York. In some respects it quite surpasses Napoleon. It is larger, sweeter
and better flavored and has a smaller pit. The trees fall short of those
of its well-known parent, however, in being less fruitful. Even more
serious defects are, in the orchard under observation, that Centennial
cracks and is less successful in resisting brown-rot than Napoleon though
it surpasses many other well-known sorts in these respects. The two
varieties under comparison may be further distinguished by the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
oblate fruits of Centennial, by a more mottled color and by the pits which
are longer and more pointed in the newer variety. Centennial is recommended
for home orchards and experimentally for commercial plantations.</p>

<p>Centennial is a seedling of Napoleon grown by Henry Chapman,
Napa, California. It came in fruit in 1876 but was not introduced until
1885, Leonard Coates of Napa, California, being the introducer. Despite
its many merits, Centennial did not win a place on the fruit list of the
American Pomological Society until 1899.</p>

<p>It seems to be the consensus of opinion of a score or more of European
and American pomologists who have known Choisy that it is the handsomest
and most delicious of all Duke cherries&mdash;one of the very best of
all dessert cherries. In it are delicately combined the richness of the
Sweet Cherry and the sprightliness of the Sour Cherry. Unfortunately,
while it bears early and regularly, the trees are seldom fruitful. As an
offset to unfruitfulness, however, the trees are vigorous, hardy and healthy.
The cherries keep and stand the wear and tear of marketing as well as those
of any other Duke. Its qualities all commend it for the home orchard
and for a local market. In particular it may be recommended for cold
climates where a true Sweet Cherry is not quite hardy, this hybrid being
nearly as hardy as the other parent, the Sour Cherry. Unfortunately
suitable specimens of this beautiful cherry could not be obtained for a
color-plate and the description has had to be compiled in part.</p>

<p>Duhamel describes two amber-colored cherries, one of which is listed
by Leroy as Belle de Choisy. The Cerise Blanche, or Cerise Ambrée
(Grosse), according to Leroy, was cultivated in Central France as early
as 1628 and in 1667 Merlet wrote of it as the most curious and rare of all
cherries. Kenrick, <cite>American Orchardist</cite>, 1832, lists a variety, Ambrée,
which according to Floy-Lindley's and Duhamel's descriptions must be
Choisy. Some writers, however, say that Choisy was first grown by M.
Gondouin, a gardener for Louis XV, in 1760, at the village of Choisy near
Paris. The American Pomological Society, in its report for 1852, mentioned
this variety as having promise and ten years later listed it in the Society's
fruit catalog where it has since remained.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, vigorous, spreading, somewhat open, hardy, but moderately productive;
branches thick, of a clear grayish color with brownish-red tips; lenticels very numerous,
large, roundish.</p>

<p>Leaves numerous, very broad, obovate, rather abruptly pointed; upper surface shining
dark green, deeply and regularly serrate to rather dentate.</p>

<p>Buds large, thick, conical, clear brown somewhat covered with gray; season of bloom
rather early; flowers white, large, numerous, borne in large clusters; petioles short, scarcely
an inch in length; petals broadly round, edges dentate; calyx-lobes short, large; pistil
longer than the stamens.</p>

<p>Fruit matures in some localities just before May Duke, in others just after that variety,
ordinarily ripe, however, at the end of June; usually attached in pairs, large, roundish to
somewhat oval, flattened toward the base; cavity shallow, wide; suture shallow, indistinct;
apex depressed; color attractive bright red mottled with yellow and amber; stem thick
at the base, one and one-half to two inches long, generally forking at about one-half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
inch from the base; skin thin, somewhat firm, semi-transparent showing the netted texture
of the pulp beneath; flesh pale amber, with abundant colorless juice, tender, melting, sweet,
pleasant flavor; very good in quality; stone medium to small, roundish, pointed at the
apex; dorsal suture indistinct; surfaces nearly smooth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cleveland is a Bigarreau which falls so far short of its near kin, as it
grows in New York at least, as not to be worth planting except as an early
cherry of its type&mdash;earliness being its one saving asset. The cherries closely
resemble Rockport in size, color, shape and flavor, are in no way better
than that somewhat mediocre sort and are even more subject to brown-rot.
It ripens with Black Tartarian and can never compete in orchard or market
with that sort. Possibly Cleveland has too much merit to be wholly
neglected yet it certainly is not worth planting in New York unless in a
locality where it does exceptionally well and when an early cherry of its
kind is wanted.</p>

<p>Cleveland is said by its introducer, Professor J. P. Kirtland, to be a
seedling from Yellow Spanish. Its close similarity to Rockport suggests
that it may have come from a pit of that variety. It was brought out in
1842 but was not adopted by the American Pomological Society for its
fruit list until 1862. Despite rapidly passing popularity it is still on this
list.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open, very productive; trunk of
medium diameter and smoothness; branches smooth, reddish-brown partly overspread
with ash-gray, with many small lenticels; branchlets slender, brown partly overspread
with ash-gray, smooth, with numerous small, inconspicuous lenticels.</p>

<p>Leaves numerous, five inches long, two and one-half inches wide, folded upward,
obovate to long-elliptical, thin; upper surface medium green, slightly rugose; lower surface
light green, lightly pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt; margin coarsely and doubly serrate,
glandular; petiole often two inches long, reddish, rather slender, hairy, grooved, glandless
or with from one to four reniform, reddish glands, usually on the stalk.</p>

<p>Buds small, short, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds or in clusters
of variable size on rather short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; flowers white, one and one-fourth
inches across; borne in scattered clusters, usually in twos; pedicels three-fourths

<p>Cluster is a curiosity, characterized by fruits borne in clusters at the
extremity of a single peduncle. The pistils vary from one to a dozen,
setting from one to five perfect fruits in the cluster or from eight to twelve
as the trees become older. The variety is little known in America but is
well known in Europe, having first been described by Daléchamp in 1586,
according to Leroy. Its origin is uncertain. Parkinson speaks of it as
Flanders Cluster, in 1629, and as it was cultivated in Germany before
1613 and nearly as soon in Switzerland it may be assumed that either
South Germany or Flanders is its native home. It appears under several
names in European fruit books, the terms trochet, bouquet, buschel, and
trauben all signifying that the fruits are borne in clusters and usually referring
to this variety. The Cerisier à Trochet of Duhamel is probably a
distinct variety. The fruit has little value and is cultivated chiefly as a
curiosity. The following description is compiled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree small and bushy, moderately vigorous, dense, productive; branches numerous,
long, slender, somewhat curved, drooping and often breaking under a load of fruit; internodes
long; leaves small, oblong, acuminate; margin doubly serrate; petiole thick, short,
rigid, with small, roundish, conspicuous glands; blooming season late; flowers small.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Fruit matures the last of June, attached in twos or threes, with from two to eight
fruits per cluster; variable in size, roundish, flattened at the extremities; suture prominent;
color clear red becoming darker at maturity; skin tough, transparent; stem long, inserted
in a deep cavity; flesh nearly white, transparent, with abundant juice which is usually
uncolored but sometimes tinged red, very tender, sour, yet agreeable; quality fair; stone
small, roundish, compressed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even earlier and certainly better than Cleveland, which we have just
discussed, is Coe, long known as Coe's Transparent. This is the first of
the light-colored cherries to ripen and is a splendid fruit in quality and
appearance. The color-plate shows this variety very well&mdash;possibly too
well, since one of its defects is variability in color, the variant usually being
very light colored and not as attractive as the type. A second defect is
that the fruit runs rather small. The tree-characters are in the main very
good. The variety can be distinguished, as a rule, by the large, spreading
tree and to a lesser extent by its hardiness, vigor, healthfulness and fruitfulness.
Coe is worthy of a place in every home plantation, in orchards
for local markets and in favored localities as an early cherry for the general
market.</p>

<p>Curtis Coe of Middletown, Connecticut, grew this variety early in the
Nineteenth Century from a pit of what he supposed to be Ox Heart. The
American Pomological Society included Coe in its list of recommended
fruits in 1856.</p>

<p>Dikeman has some merit as a very late Sweet Cherry but here its usefulness
ends. The cherries are too small and the pits too large for this
variety to have great worth. The tree is somewhat remarkable for its
spreading habit and stout branches. Plant-breeders seeking for a very
late sort might well choose Dikeman as a parent.</p>

<p>Two very similar cherries, with a variation in the spelling, pass under
this name. Late in the Eighteenth Century there appeared a cherry on
the Dyckman farm near New York City. Some thought it to be identical
with Black Tartarian; others said it was distinct and called it Dyckman.
It was never more than of local note. Some few years ago the late S. D.
Willard of Geneva introduced the Dikeman cherry from the farm of George
B. Dikeman, Oceana County, Michigan. This variety often goes under
the name Dykeman but from the information at hand we feel certain that
Dikeman is the correct spelling. On our grounds this variety and Black
Tartarian, although similar, are two distinct sorts, the Dikeman being
later, firmer and a clingstone.</p>

<p>Double Glass is a Duke, a hybrid more nearly resembling the Sweet
Cherry than the Sour Cherry. The trees grow remarkably well in nursery
and orchard and their behavior so pleased growers when the variety was
brought to notice that it became for a time quite the vogue. But the
trees turned out to be unproductive and the cherries so mediocre that
the variety rapidly passed through its heyday of popularity. The fruits
are curiously marked, the suture being so deep as to make them appear
double&mdash;hence the name. The variety has no value where sweet sorts
are hardy but possibly might find a niche somewhere in regions where a
more tender Sweet Cherry cannot be grown.</p>

<p>This variety, of ancient and unknown origin, dates back at least to
1792 when Truchsess received it from Christ under the names Grosse
Frühkirsche and Englische Erzherzogskirsche, both of which were incorrect,
the first because it was not characteristic since the fruit did not ripen early,
and the second because it denoted a class of dark-fleshed cherries. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
France, Double Glass has long been cultivated under the name Amarelle
Double de Verre. The variety was brought to America from Russia in
1883 by Professor J. L. Budd. While grown for a time in the Central
States it was never highly regarded and has now nearly passed from
cultivation. The following description is a compilation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading becoming divergent with age, usually hardy,
rather unproductive; branchlets thick, reddish-brown; leaves healthy, small to medium,
ovate, with serrated margins; buds large, prominent.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the latter part of June; usually large, roundish-oblate, with a very
deep suture; color light red becoming much darker at maturity; stem long, thick; skin
thin, tough, translucent; flesh yellowish, with abundant uncolored juice, firm, tender,
sprightly; good in quality; stone medium in size, roundish.</p></blockquote>

<p>Budd's importations of Russian cherries, to which reference is so often
made in this text, brought forth almost universal praise for any and all
of the foreign sorts. Cultural tests soon demonstrated, however, that most
of the varieties were comparatively worthless; Double Natte is one of
these. It is a very mediocre cherry of the Morello group in nowise equal
to English Morello except when earliness is a prime requisite, this sort
being one of the earliest of the Morellos. In flavor it is equal to English
Morello but is no better. At Geneva the trees are seldom very fruitful.
From the eulogistic reports of its behavior in the Middle West it would
seem that it was better adapted to Iowa, for instance, than for New York.</p>

<p>This variety was first mentioned by Knoop, the Dutch pomologist,

imported from Russia a cherry under the name Riga No. 18. This cherry
has been grown as a separate variety under the name Riga but the
descriptions of it are all identical with those of Double Natte and there
can be no doubt but that they are one and the same.</p>

<p>Downer is a Sweet Cherry, one of the so-called "Hearts" much prized
by those who know it as a late cherry delicately and richly flavored. Possibly
it is the best of the late Sweet Cherries. Several defects keep it from
being of any considerable worth; it thrives only in the choicest soils; the
trees are often unhealthy as well as lacking in vigor; the flesh is thin and
the stone is large; and, though the cherries set abundantly, the yield is small
because the fruits are small. So, while the variety is almost indispensable
in a home orchard, ripening after almost all of the dessert cherries have
gone, Downer has small place in a commercial plantation. It should be
said further in its favor, however, as a commercial fruit, that it stands
harvesting and shipping very well.</p>

<p>Downer takes the name of Samuel Downer, Dorchester, Massachusetts,
who grew it some time before 1832 when it first found a place in pomological
works. It was included by the American Pomological Society in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
schedule of fruits in 1848 as Downer's Late. It now appears as Downer
with Downer's Late Red as a synonym in accordance with the rules of
the Society.</p>

<p>Dyehouse is conspicuous among cherries for its earliness and for the
beauty of its fruit. Early Richmond is the standard early cherry yet
Dyehouse is a week earlier, just as attractive in appearance and equally
well flavored. It is near of kin to Early Richmond but the two may be
distinguished by the difference in time of ripening and by its brighter,
clearer color, greater opaqueness, more highly colored juice and slightly
smaller size. Possibly this cherry would supersede the better-known Early
Richmond were it not for the defect in size and for the further faults of
being less productive and more capricious to environment, as it fails to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
thrive in localities where the older sort is quite at home. It is a worthy
rival of Early Richmond, however, and ought to be grown both for home
and commercial purposes far more than it is.</p>

<p>To H. T. Harris of Stamford, Kentucky, belongs the honor of introducing
this well-known cherry. Although its parentage is unknown, it is
almost certain that a Mr. Dyehouse, Lincoln County, Kentucky, raised
the tree from a pit sixty or more years ago. At the time of its introduction
its characteristics were not clearly drawn and many believed it to be the
Early Richmond. In time, however, differences were shown, as we have
set forth in the preceding paragraph. It was added to the fruit list of the
American Pomological Society in 1897.</p>

<p>We hesitatingly follow the American Pomological Society in calling
this variety Eagle when it has so long been known as Black Eagle, the
name given it by the great pomologist, Knight. Were this choicely good
cherry larger in size, it would still be a prime favorite with growers for in
many respects it is one of the best varieties of its species. Its flavor is
excellent; the trees are usually fruitful; it ripens at a good time in the
cherry season, just after Black Tartarian; the cherries are less liable to
crack than many of its rivals; and the trees are as hardy, healthy and
vigorous as those of any Sweet Cherry. Some complain that the trees do
not bear well at first but are productive only with age. But, after all, it
is its high quality that gives Eagle so much merit that it ought not to be
forgotten&mdash;makes it worth a place in every home orchard and commends
it highly to commercial growers of cherries who want a finely finished
product for either local or general market. The fruit-stems of this variety
are characteristically long.</p>

<p>Eagle was grown about 1806 by Sir Thomas Andrew Knight at Downton
Castle, Wiltshire, England, by fertilizing the Bigarreau of the old
writers, our Yellow Spanish, with pollen of the May Duke. The correctness
of the parentage as given has been questioned because of its inherited
characteristics. But if the May Duke is a hybrid between a Sweet and a
Sour, a pure Sweet offspring is not an impossibility. In 1823, Honorable
John Lowell of Massachusetts received Eagle from Knight. Prince mentioned
this cherry in his <cite>Treatise of Horticulture</cite>, 1828, but the exact date
of its introduction into New York is unknown. In 1848 it was placed on
the list of fruits adopted by the National Convention of Fruit Growers
and since then it has been retained on the fruit list of the American Pomological
Society.</p>

<p>As the only cultivated representative of the European Dwarf Cherry,
Early May should be of especial interest to cherry-growers. It is a true
dwarf variety, the trees seldom attaining a height of more than six or seven
feet. Both tree and branches are very flexible so that Early May is well
adapted to the wall-training of European countries. It has further value
in its earliness, being the earliest of all cherries. It is doubtful whether
the variety can now be obtained in America but it ought to be reintroduced
both for the fruit and because it is a handsome ornamental. Early May
has several characters to recommend it to plant-breeders. The description
herewith given is compiled from European fruit-books.</p>

<p>Pliny in his <cite>Natural History</cite> mentions the Macedonian and the Chamaecerasus
cherries, both of which we now believe to have been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus
fruticosa</i>, the European Dwarf Cherry. Early May, according to European
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
botanists, is a variety of this dwarf species and may be the identical cherry
that Pliny described. Following Pliny it was mentioned by Estienne, a
Frenchman, in 1540, by Knoop, the Dutch pomologist, in 1771, by Parkinson,
the English herbalist, in 1629, and, as the references show, by most
pomologists since. The names May and Early May have been applied to
several varieties, and especially in the West to the Early Richmond but
all are distinct and ought not to be confused with this, the true variety.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree very small, rather weak; branches numerous, slender, somewhat curved, flexible,
branchlets slender, pendant; leaves abundant, very small, obovate or oblong, acuminate;
margin irregularly and deeply serrate; petiole short, slender, without glands; blooming
season very early; flowers small; petals oval.</p>

<p>Fruit matures very early, usually attached in pairs; small, roundish, slightly flattened;
suture indistinct; color bright red becoming dark red at full maturity; stem one inch long,
slender, set in a small, regular cavity; skin thin; flesh yellowish-white, sometimes tinged
red under the skin, tender, juicy, brisk but pleasant subacid; quality fair; stone very small,
roundish.</p></blockquote>

<h3>EARLY MORELLO</h3>

</ul>

<p>This, which we think is the true Early Morello, is worthy an extended
description in <cite>The Cherries of New York</cite> chiefly because there are several
cherries of this name. The confusion results in much vexation to cherry-growers
in the West where, only, these cherries have been planted. The
full description should make clear at least the character of the variety
which is being grown at this Station as Early Morello. About all that
can be said of the variety as it grows here is that the trees are hardy, healthy,
vigorous, fruitful and regular in bearing. The cherries show the variety to
be of the Amarelle group but are such as to make it far inferior to Montmorency
and other well-known Amarelles. The name is misleading, as
the variety has little in common, in tree or fruit, with the true Morellos.</p>

<p>The cherry described here as Early Morello was introduced by
Professor J. L. Budd from Orel, Russia, as Orel No. 23. It has proved
very productive and hardy throughout the West and resembles Early
Richmond, though smaller, a trifle darker, less acid and a week later. A
dark-fleshed variety from Erfurt, Prussia, was sent out from Rosedale,
Kansas, where it is known as Early Morello. This, and one by D. U.
Reed, Blue Springs, Nebraska, appear to be very similar to the Northwest,
or Wier No. 29.

<p>Early Purple is a valuable cherry on account of its earliness, its attractive
color and high quality. The trees bear well and regularly after having
become established in the orchard. The variety has the reputation of
being a poor grower in the nursery and as a young tree in the orchard but
with age it takes on vigor and at all times is as healthy as those of any
Sweet Cherry. More than most cherries, this variety responds to good
care and a choice cherry soil&mdash;a warm, free-working loam being best. A
rather unusual and serious defect of this variety is that the fruit-spurs
are easily broken during picking and the crop of the next season thereby
cut short. Another fault is that it is the favorite food of the robin where
this, the worst of all cherry pests, abounds. The cherries of this variety
do not attain their rich purple color until full maturity is reached. Hogg,
the English pomologist, maintains that Early Purple does better on the
Mahaleb than on the Mazzard stock. No home collection should be
without this variety and it can often be profitably grown as an early cherry
for the local market.</p>

<p>Early Purple is the Early Purple Guigne of most fruit-books, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
name having been shortened by the American Pomological Society, though,
since the variety goes back to the Early Purple of Ray in 1688, the name
here used has the right of precedence. As to what the origin and history
of the variety were before Ray mentioned it, we can find no record. Early
Purple was brought to America over a hundred years ago. According to
Elliott, eastern growers received it directly from England, while in the
West it was brought over by a party of German emigrants, under the name
"German May Duke" and as such it is still much grown in localities in
the Central West. In 1852, the American Pomological Society listed
Early Purple as one of the promising new fruits and later, in 1856, it was

<p>Early Richmond has long been the leading Sour Cherry of its season&mdash;the
first of its kind in the markets. It is not a remarkable variety in
its fruit-characters, the cherries being but medium in size, mediocre in
quality and not handsomer than other Amarelles with which it belongs.
It is, however, a very good culinary fruit and when well ripened may be
eaten out of hand with relish by those who like the refreshing acidity of
a Sour Cherry. Though not in nearly as great demand for canning as
Montmorency it still makes a very good canned product, being used more
than it otherwise would be to prolong the canning season because of its
earliness. Before cherries were largely canned for the markets, Early
Richmond was much used in making dried cherries, the product, rightly
cured, making a delicious sweetmeat which would keep for several months.
The cherries are remarkable for the tenacity with which the stone clings
to the stem. It is the tree in which the Early Richmond particularly
surpasses. It thrives in varied soils and climates from the St. Lawrence
to the Carolinas and from the Atlantic to the Pacific&mdash;possibly the most
cosmopolitan of all cherries&mdash;and everywhere vigorous, healthy and fruitful.
For the many purposes for which it may be used and because of the
characters of the tree, Early Richmond is indispensable in every home and
commercial orchard for an early cherry. After Montmorency it is more
largely grown than any other cherry, Sweet or Sour, in New York.</p>

<p>Early Richmond is the old Kentish of English writers, confused more
or less with the different Montmorencies. Whether or not this variety
was introduced into Kent, England, by the Romans and became thus
early the Kentish or whether it came from Flanders or Holland where it
was called Cerise de Volger, is not now certain. Probably, however, it is
one of the many seedlings of the Cerise Commune, as are the Montmorencies,
and was first known as Cerisier Hâtif. Early in the Sixteenth
Century the gardener of Henry VIII made extensive plantings in Kent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
with trees supposed to have come from Flanders, and Parkinson, in 1629,
mentions a variety as Flanders which was probably this cherry. The
variety, soon known by many English writers as Kentish, was confused by
the French who seem to have had two Kentish cherries. In English nurseries
Kentish was soon confused with Montmorency. In this way the
terms Kentish, Flanders, Flemish and Montmorency came into use for this
sort. It was early brought to America where it became known as Early
Richmond but even here it has several names. The belief that it originated
at Richmond, Virginia, was due to the fact that William Prince
secured his first trees from that source. By whom the variety was introduced
into this country is unknown, although Thacher speaks of it as early
as 1822. In the South it became known as Virginia May, while in the
West it has been called Early May. The variety appeared on the fruit list
of the American Pomological Society as Kentish in 1862 but in 1871 the
name was changed to Early Richmond. It is listed by all prominent nurseries
in this country as Richmond or Early Richmond while in England
it is still known as Kentish. The French cherry, often spoken of as
"the common French cherry," introduced into the lower St. Lawrence
region, is very similar to Early Richmond. This strain, propagated from
seed or sprouts, seems to be somewhat hardier than Early Richmond and
varies slightly from it in size and quality.</p>

<p>Elkhorn has served its day and is now being rapidly superseded by
other cherries of the Bigarreau group to which it belongs. It was valued
by the old pomologists because of the large size of the fruit, the firm flesh,
late ripening, rich flavor, and because it hangs well on the tree long after
maturity. But it fails in competition with other Bigarreaus in bearing
cherries quite variable in size, in the diminishing size of the fruit as the
trees attain age and more than all else in being but moderately productive.
The bark of the trunk and main branches is so heavily overspread with
gray as to make this a distinguishing mark. The fruit, too, is distinct in
appearance by reason of the irregular surface of the skin. The variety
possesses no characters, as it usually grows, to make it worth planting
either for home or market.</p>

<p>The history of this old cherry was almost hopelessly confused by
the early horticulturists by the vast number of names they used for it,
many of which belonged to other varieties. Elkhorn is supposed to have
been raised by John Tradescant, gardener to Charles I of England, under
the name Tradescant's Black Heart. Of this cherry, John Parkinson in
1629 says: "John Tradescantes Cherrie is most usually sold by our
Nursery Gardiners, for the Archdukes cherrie, because they have more
plenty thereof, and will better be increased, and because it is so faire and
good a cherrie that it may be obtruded without much discontent: it is a
reasonably good bearer, a faire great berrie, deepe coloured, and a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
pointed." It is not known when or how Elkhorn got to America. The first
cherry-grower in this country to mention it was William Prince, in 1832,
who says that his father noticed the variety growing in a garden next to
a hotel in Maryland about 1797 and brought cions of it to New York afterwards
propagating and selling it under the name Elkhorn given to the
cherry by the hotel proprietor. Elkhorn was at one time very popular
and well disseminated throughout the United States and is sold now by a
large number of nurserymen either under the name Tradescant's Black
Heart or as Elkhorn. In 1862, the American Pomological Society listed
in its fruit catalog Tradescant's Black Heart but dropped it in 1877. In
1899 this Society placed the variety in its catalog under the name Elkhorn
and it still remains on its list of recommended fruits. From its history
it is apparent that this cherry is rightly called Tradescant or Black Heart
or by some combination of these terms but Elkhorn has been adopted by
the American Pomological Society, is everywhere in common use on this
continent and is so distinctive that we choose for this text the newer name.</p>

<p>Elton has been freely recommended and widely cultivated in Europe
and America for the past century and probably no cherry has given more
general satisfaction. The variety is distinguished by the form, color, flesh
and flavor of its fruit. The cherries are oblong-heart-shaped&mdash;possibly
too much drawn out for best appearance and often too oblique; the color,
very well shown in the color-plate, is most attractive and makes up for
any defect in shape&mdash;a dark red mottled with amber, very bright, clear
and glossy; the flesh, a little too soft to ship well, is delicate and most
pleasing to the palate; the flavor is peculiarly rich and luscious being hardly
surpassed by that of any other cherry. The trees may be as readily told
as the fruit, by the unusually dark red color of the petioles of the leaves.
The branches are stout and bear the crop thickly placed close to the wood and
in prodigious quantities. Unfortunately it has a fault which in America, at
least, makes it almost unfit for a commercial plantation. Brown-rot, the
scourge of the Sweet Cherry, attacks this variety more aggressively than
almost any other sort and for this reason, while its merits can hardly be
too highly spoken of, Elton must remain for most part a variety for the
home orchard. The tree, perfect in most respects, is a little tender to
cold. Leroy, the French pomologist, thinks it does better on Mahaleb than
on the Mazzard stock.</p>

<p>This is another cherry from Thomas Andrew Knight, the great English
pomologist. Knight fruited it first about 1806, the tree coming from a pit
of Yellow Spanish, the paternal parent being White Heart. From the
first it took a high place in English and continental pomology as it did
also in America upon being brought here in 1823. The variety is everywhere
known and grown in America and is for sale by many nurserymen.
Elton was one of the fruits to receive attention at the first meeting of the
American Pomological Society in 1848, and in 1852 was put on the list of
recommended fruits where it still remains.</p>

<p>This old French cherry, for many years largely advertised and widely
sold in America, does not thrive in the New World as well as the reports
say it does in the Old World. The two faults that condemn it, as it grows
here, are that the cherries ripen very unevenly making several pickings
necessary and the trees are so small that, though loaded with fruit, the
total yield is not large. Lesser faults are that the cherries are not uniform
in shape and are borne thickly in close clusters so that when brown-rot is
rife this variety suffers greatly. The short stem, too, prevents easy picking.
To offset these faults Empress Eugenie has to its credit the reputation of
being about the most refreshing and delicious Duke. In a home plantation
where the unevenness in ripening can be utilized to prolong the season and
where dwarfness may not be undesirable, Empress Eugenie may well find
a place.</p>

<p>This cherry appeared in 1845 as a chance seedling on the grounds of
M. Varenne at Belleville, near Paris, France. It first fruited about 1850
and four years later the Horticultural Society of Paris placed it, under
the name Impératrice Eugenie, on its list of recommended fruits. M. A.
Gontier, a nurseryman at Fontenay-aux-Roses introduced it to commerce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
in 1855. Empress Eugenie soon became quite generally disseminated
throughout Europe and was considered nearly as good as May Duke, with
which it has occasionally been confused. It must have been brought to
America towards the beginning of the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century
and here it gradually became widely distributed until today it is
found in all the leading cherry plantations and is propagated by a large
number of nurserymen throughout the United States. The American
Pomological Society added this cherry to its fruit catalog list in 1877 under
the name Empress Eugenie. In 1883 this name was shortened to Eugenie
under which term it has since appeared in the Society's catalog. In <cite>The
Cherries of New York</cite> we have not adopted the shortened name as, by such
a change, all trace is lost of the person after whom the cherry was christened.</p>

<p>English Morello is the best of all its group and is the standard late
Sour Cherry in North America, occupying at the close of the season the
place held by Montmorency in mid-season for home, market and cannery.
It is not a table fruit and can hardly be eaten out of hand until it loses
some of its astringency and acidity by thorough ripening. In any way
the cherries are prepared by cooking, however, it is one of the best, culinary
processes giving the fruits a rich, dark wine color, very attractive in
appearance, and a most pleasant, sprightly, aromatic flavor. The fruit is
handsome in appearance, bears harvesting and shipping well, is resistant
to brown-rot and hangs long on the trees after ripening, often until the last
of August if robins can be kept away. Once seen, one may always know
the trees. They are small, round-headed, with branches that distinctly
droop. To be sufficiently productive an English Morello orchard must be
closely set; for, though the trees are vigorous and productive for their
size, they are too dwarf to yield heavily. The trees are hardy but not
always healthy and are not adapted to as great a diversity of soils as might
be wished. The variety distinctly fails in its tree-characters. The demand
for English Morello has recently decreased and it is doubtful if it ever
regains its popularity of a decade ago. There is a place for a late cherry
which English Morello now fills but not sufficiently well.</p>

<p>All of the early pomologists describe a Morello or a Morella but no
one of them definitely gives its place of origin. The concensus of opinion
is that it originated in either Holland or Germany from whence it was
introduced into England and later into France. The early German writers
listed a Grosse Lange Lothkirsche which is English Morello. Preceding
them, Duhamel described the Grosse Cerise à Ratafia "as one praised for
confitures and preserving," which is probably this cherry. Leroy believed
English Morello to be the cherry that Mortillet brought to Paris from
Holland calling it Griotte du Nord though he thought the variety had
been grown in France for many years previous but under another name.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
It is possible that the term Du Nord originated through its being widely
grown as an espalier demanding a northern exposure, rather than as some
have thought, because it came from northern Germany. In 1862 English
Morello was put on the fruit list of the American Pomological Society
where it still remains. Wragg is thought to be identical with this cherry
by some and, if not, it differs but little. Northern Griotte and Grosse
Lange Lothkirsche, introduced by Budd from Russia, are English Morello.
Morris, or Colorado Morello, put out by John Morris of Golden, Colorado,
once thought to be distinct, is also English Morello.</p>

worth planting, since it is, all and all, surpassed by its better-known rival.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
The fruit hangs on the tree in edible condition an almost phenomenal length
of time which has given rise to much divergence of opinion as to its season,
some pomologists rating it as early, others as mid-season and still others
as late. At Geneva the trees of this variety are not as healthful, vigorous
or as fruitful as those of Yellow Spanish, with which it must compete,
nor are the cherries quite as fine in appearance or quality.</p>

<p>This variety was found in Florence, Italy, early in the Nineteenth
Century by John Houblon, who took it to England from whence it was
brought to America. It found a place in 1885 on the fruit list of the American
Pomological Society where it remained until 1891, when it was
discarded, with quite sufficient reason.</p>

<p>George Glass has been widely heralded as a desirable variety in the
Middle West but in New York, where it has passed through a rather
lengthy probationary period, practically all who have tried it are ready to
declare it worthless. It is of the Amarelle group and cannot compete
with the many good varieties of its kinship, as the Early Richmond or
the several Montmorencies. Its season is between Early Richmond and
Montmorency. As compared with the last-named variety, the standard
Sour Cherry, the fruit of George Glass is smaller, sourer, less attractive in
appearance and the trees are far less fruitful. Possibly the trees are more
hardy, this character commending it for the colder parts of the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p>The origin of this variety is uncertain but it is supposed to have been
introduced into Iowa by immigrants from northeastern Germany. In
American collections it has often been confused with Brusseler Braune
and Bessarabian and by some is declared to be identical with the latter
sort. It is supposed to be a cross between a Duke and a Morello cherry.</p>

<p>This Sour Cherry, of the Morello group, is too poor in quality to
recommend it for any purpose. The fruit is scarcely edible until dead ripe
and even then is too puckering to eat out of hand with relish. The cherries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
are very attractive, being large for the kind, heart-shaped, of a handsome,
clear, glossy dark purple color and very uniform in all characters. The
tree is conspicuous because of its symmetrical shape, large size, round head
and its many branches and branchlets. The leaves are characteristically
small, as are the flowers, which are further distinguished by very narrow
petals. The tree is hardy and productive and quite worth a place on a
lawn as an ornamental if not in the garden for its fruit. The variety has
several characters to commend it to plant-breeders.</p>

<p>This variety came to light in written records in the early part of the
Nineteenth Century in German fruit-books under the name Saure Herzkirsche
or Herzkirschweichsel and was highly recommended for its fine
flavor. Professor J. L. Budd of Iowa, in one of his European trips, was
impressed with its symmetrical habit of growth and its abundant foliage
where he found it growing in eastern Europe as a lawn tree. He
included it among his importations but it has not proved valuable in the
New World.</p>

<p>This variety, one of the oldest, has been called by a great number of
names by European writers. The cherry mentioned by Duhamel, in 1768,
as a late Guigne with red fruit, otherwise known as Guigne de Fer, can
be no other than Hildesheim. The exact origin of the variety has never
been known, though it is supposed to have sprung up in the neighborhood
of Hildesheim, Prussia. It was brought to America early in the Nineteenth
Century, probably by William Prince. With it came some of
the numerous foreign names. It seems certain that Late Red Guigne
mentioned by Prince was Hildesheim. Ripening late and being small
and of rather undesirable texture, Hildesheim did not meet with much
favor in America, never being widely disseminated, and has long since
passed from cultivation. This variety, under the name Belle Agathe, was
propagated in Belgium by M. Thiery about 1852 and for some time was
supposed to be a separate sort. The following description is compiled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree very large, vigorous, upright, hardy, an annual bearer, unproductive while
young producing good crops later; branches thick, large, long, straight; leaves numerous,
of medium size, oval or elongated-oval, acuminate; margin finely and regularly serrate;
petiole slender, rather short, tinged red, with large, flattened glands; blooming season
early.</p>

<p>Fruit matures very late, usually attached in fives but sometimes in threes and fours;
small to medium, roundish-cordate, flattened on one side, somewhat irregular; color
yellowish, mottled and marbled with dark red; stem two inches long, slender, somewhat
curved; skin thick; flesh pale yellow, slightly tinged with red at the pit, firm, somewhat
stringy, rather dry, with uncolored juice, pleasant flavored, sweet; quality good; stone
medium to large, with reddish surface, long, compressed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ida is a handsome, large, light red cherry resembling Napoleon in shape
and Rockport in color, but differing from both in having soft flesh which
places it among the Hearts rather than the Bigarreaus. Because of beauty
of the fruit, earliness and good tree-characters, Ida promises to become a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
rather general favorite in home orchards though it falls short of several
others of its near of kin in flavor and flesh-characters. It can never take
a high place among commercial kinds because the cherries are too soft to
handle well, show bruises plainly, are somewhat susceptible to brown-rot
and come when better cherries are plentiful. The trees are vigorous,
hardy and bear full crops regularly and in various environments. The
variety is readily told by the upright habit of growth and by the large
lenticels on trunk and branches. Ida has been very well tried as a commercial
variety in this State but in the ups and downs of the industry has
not held its own with other sorts and can be recommended only for home
plantations.</p>

<p>E. H. Cocklin of Shepherdstown, Pennsylvania, grew this variety as
a seedling of Cocklin's Favorite, another of his cherries. The cherry was
named after his daughter, Ida. It seems to have proved worthy of general
culture, as it is now listed by many nurserymen. The American Pomological
Society placed Ida on its fruit list in 1909.</p>

<p>This old variety, which has almost passed from cultivation, may have
had its origin in France about the middle of the Eighteenth Century,
though more likely it originated in England much earlier. Leroy mentions
a Royale cherry which was introduced from England to France about
1730 and was first grown by M. le Normand in the garden of Louis XV.
The name Royale was first used by the French about 1735 from the fact
that it was grown in the royal gardens and since that time this name has
clung to the variety in most of the French plantations. According to
English writers, the variety was brought to notice in England by Jeffrey,
proprietor of the Brompton Nursery at Brompton Park, England, and
from that time it was known as Jeffrey's Duke. English pomologists maintain
that Jeffrey renamed the old Cherry Duke of England, giving it
his name. Jeffrey Duke appeared on the American Pomological Society's
fruit catalog list in 1862 but was dropped in 1871. It is doubtful if the
variety can now be found in America. The following description is compiled
from the authors given in the references:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, vigorous, very upright, unusually compact, slow-growing, productive;
branches very numerous, stocky, straight, thickly set with fruit-spurs; internodes short;
branchlets very short; buds closely set; leaves numerous, medium in size, oval or obovate,
acuminate; margin finely and irregularly serrate; petiole short, slender, with small, flattened
or globose glands; blooming season late; flowers small, very open.</p>

<p>Fruit matures in mid-season, usually attached in pairs; medium in size, roundish,
slightly flattened at the apex and base; suture a well-marked line; color lively red becoming
dark red or almost black when fully ripe; stem slender, inserted in a moderately broad,
deep cavity; skin thin; flesh firm but tender, yellowish-amber, with abundant colored
juice, slightly stringy, highly flavored; good in quality; stone small, roundish, tinged
with red.</p></blockquote>

<p>King Amarelle is an old European cherry that has taken on new life
in America. It is of the Early Richmond type, differing from this standard
Amarelle in bearing fruit a little earlier, lighter in color and with a longer
stem. The fault which all but condemns the variety as a commercial cherry
is the small size of the fruit, the cherries running smaller than those of
Early Richmond which, in its turn, is rather too small. The tree is very
like that of Early Richmond&mdash;quite as vigorous and productive, the
same in size and shape and, if anything, a little more hardy. The variety is
told from afar in blossoming-time by the peculiar distribution of the flower-clusters,
which are numerous and dense but always separated by several
inches or a foot of bare wood. King Amarelle can never displace Early
Richmond but might be tried where a somewhat hardier cherry is wanted
or it might be planted as a substitute where the better-known sort fails.</p>

<p>This variety, of old and uncertain origin, sprang up in France about
the same time as the Montmorencies and became confused with them.
In both fruit and tree-characters, however, King Amarelle is very different
from the Montmorencies, being more like Early May but ripening later
and making a larger tree. The cultivation of King Amarelle never became
extended in Europe because of the inferior quality of the fruit and poor
tree-characters. Professor J. L. Budd brought the variety to America
from Russia about 1883. The Royal Amarelle, grown on the Canadian
Experiment Station grounds in 1900, is undoubtedly King Amarelle. The
American Pomological Society placed it on its list of recommended
fruits in 1909.</p>

<p>In the collection of cherries at this Station, Kirtland stands among
the best of the Bigarreaus in quality of fruit&mdash;in fact is hardly surpassed
in richness and delicacy of flavor. The fruit, too, as may be seen from
the color-plate, is handsome, the cherries resembling the well-known
Napoleon but being a little darker in color. The flesh is firm and meaty
and stands handling well and also resists the brown-rot as well as any
other cherry. With these splendid qualities of fruit, Kirtland would long
ago have been one of the standard commercial cherries were its tree-characters
better. Wherever tried, the complaint comes that the trees lack
vigor and can be grown successfully only on choice cherry soils and under
the best of care. With these faults the variety can be recommended only for
home orchards and for local markets where there is demand for a very early
Bigarreau, since this variety ripens before most other cherries of its kind.</p>

<p>Kirtland was grown in 1842 by Professor J. P. Kirtland of Cleveland,
Ohio, and ranks foremost in quality and appearance of all the seedlings
raised by this well-known cherry-breeder.  The American Pomological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Society, in 1852, mentioned this sort as deserving of further trial and, in
1854, listed it among the varieties of promising fruits. Elliott, in his
<cite>Fruit Book</cite>, noted this cherry under the name Kirtland's Mary, in honor
of Professor Kirtland's daughter, and classed it as a variety worthy of
general cultivation. Hogg, in 1866, dropped the name Kirtland and listed
it as Mary, while in the <cite>American Pomological Society's Special Report</cite>
for 1905 it is called Kirtland. According to the rules of pomological
nomenclature, Hogg was correct in holding the name Mary but, since
there is another Mary and no worthy sort bearing the name of so eminent
a horticulturist as Professor Kirtland, this Station follows the American
Pomological Society in the use of Kirtland.</p>

<p>This old English variety has long been popular in America, where it
is generally known as Knight's Early Black, this name having been shortened
by the American Pomological Society to Knight. Possibly Knight is
to be found in dooryards and home gardens in Eastern United States as
often as any other Sweet Cherry with the exception of Black Tartarian.
The characters which give it popularity are excellent quality, handsome
appearance because of its glossy, dark purple color and uniformity in color,
shape and size, and its earliness, it being the earliest good Sweet Cherry.
Unfortunately, even in the best soil and under the most painstaking treatment,
the cherries run small, a defect for American markets. The small
size also leads to comparatively low yields even though the fruits are often
borne in prodigious numbers. Knight, in size, color and flavor, is much
like Black Tartarian but the cherries are smaller and ripen earlier. As
the trees grow on the grounds of this Station they are about all that could
be desired in a Sweet Cherry. The trees are characteristically marked by
smooth bark which is dotted with large lenticels. There are now
better sweet varieties than Knight for most purposes but still this old
variety has too many merits, especially for home grounds, to be wholly
forgotten.</p>

<p>Knight comes from a seed of May Duke crossed with Yellow Spanish
by T. A. Knight, Downton Castle, Wiltshire, England, about 1810. The
new variety sprang into prominence almost immediately, being mentioned
by French, German and English writers. Knight is still one of the well-recognized
sorts in Europe and America and has appeared continuously
on the fruit list of the American Pomological Society since 1848. Mathieu
has included several synonyms under this head which we question as we
believe they belong to the Guigne Noir Hâtive, a distinct variety though
very similar.</p>

<p>Nowhere else in America, possibly nowhere else in the world, can the
Sweet Cherry be grown as well as in Oregon and Washington. From these
States, more particularly Oregon, several meritorious cherries have been
added to pomology. One of the best of these is Lambert, now a standard
sort in its native State but still on probation in Eastern America. Lambert
is a Bigarreau, a seedling of Napoleon by Black Heart, and a worthy
rival of its parents in most respects and superior in some. In appearance,
Lambert is more like its male than its female parent, having much the
same shape and color, but it is larger, more rotund, smoother, clearer
and brighter&mdash;one of the handsomest of the dark-colored Sweets. The
flesh and flavor leave little to be desired; the flesh is purplish-red marbled
with lighter red, firm, meaty and juicy, with a sweet, rich flavor that at
the first taste one marks very good. The tree is strong, vigorous, healthy
and usually fruitful and regular in bearing. The fruit sets in great, loose
clusters&mdash;often a dozen or more cherries to the fruit-spur. The leaves
are remarkably large and dark green, the foliage betokening the vigor of
the variety. Lambert is well worthy thorough testing for either home or
market wherever the Sweet Cherry can be grown.</p>

<p>Lambert originated as a seedling under a Napoleon tree which was
planted by the late Henderson Lewelling<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> about 1848 in the orchard of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
J. H. Lambert, Milwaukee, Oregon. This seedling, supposed to have been
a cross between Napoleon and Black Heart, was grafted to May Duke
and later transplanted. About 1880, the top died and a sprout from the
seedling stock formed a new top. Mr. Lambert gave the new variety his
name and in 1895 turned over his stock to the Oregon Horticultural Society
with the exclusive right to propagate. The variety was placed on the
fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1899 where it still remains.</p>

<p>As its synonyms show, Large Montmorency has been grown under
various names in Europe and America&mdash;a testimony to its merits. Were
it not that the true Montmorency is so much more fruitful than this larger-fruited
offshoot of the same race of Amarelle cherries, Large Montmorency
would be a leading commercial Sour Cherry, for it is equal to the smaller-fruited
strain in all other characters with the advantage of size. The
relationship between this and the other Montmorencies is apparent but
Large Montmorency is easily distinguished by several marked characters
from the common Montmorency, known by all, with which it is most
often confused. Its fruits are more often borne singly, are larger, have a
shorter, thicker stem, are more oblate and ripen a little earlier. The trees
are more upright, with stouter branches and are far less fruitful. The
flesh-characters of the two kinds are much the same&mdash;excellent in both,
the flavor being particularly refreshing to those who like the acidity of the
Sour Cherry. Large Montmorency has been tried and found so wanting
in productiveness that it can rarely be recommended as a commercial
variety but it is much too good a fruit to be wholly lost and should be
grown by connoisseurs who want a large, finely flavored Sour Cherry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>This variety has been much confused with other cherries, particularly
Montmorency, Early Richmond and Short Stem Montmorency. Bradley,
in 1739, mentioned a Flemish cherry which undoubtedly was the Large
Montmorency of today, for the name Flemish has rather commonly been
applied to this sort since Bradley's time. There is no doubt but that
Large Montmorency sprang up about the same time as the true Montmorency,
in the Montmorency Valley in France. It may have been a
seedling of the Cerise Hâtive, afterwards known as Early Richmond, though
some writers are of the opinion that the Montmorencies and Cerise Hâtive
were all seedlings of the old Cerise Commune. At any rate, there have
come to be at least three distinct types of Montmorency: the true Montmorency
with long stems and moderate-sized fruit, called Montmorency à
Longue Queue or, in America, Montmorency Ordinaire; the Large Montmorency
with its large fruit and shorter, thicker stems, commonly known
by the French and German writers as Montmorency à Gros Fruit, Gros
Gobet, Grosse Glaskirsche von Montmorency and sometimes as Montmorency
à Courte Queue; and the Short-Stem Montmorency, often called
Montmorency à Courte Queue and sometimes Gros Gobet. Large Montmorency
has often been sold for Montmorency, or for Early Richmond,
hence the three varieties are more or less confused. Large Montmorency
probably came to America about the same time as Montmorency
and Early Richmond, early in the Nineteenth Century. In 1875,
Ellwanger &amp; Barry, Rochester, New York, disseminated this sort quite
extensively but later it proved too unproductive for commercial use. It
was soon replaced by the true Montmorency but often the names were
interchanged and large forms of the Montmorency were thought to be
this variety. The unproductiveness of this cherry has been consistently
mentioned by nearly every writer from Duhamel's time to the present.
Large Montmorency was added to the American Pomological Society's
catalog list of fruits in 1885 as Montmorency Large but in 1899 this name
was changed to Large Montmorency.</p>

<p>Late Duke is a variant of the well-known May Duke, ripening from
two weeks to a month later. The size, color, flavor and season of the
fruit all commend it, as do the vigor, health and fruitfulness of the trees.
The cherries are not quite as sweet as those of May Duke, a little more
marbled in color of skin and ripen through a longer season. The trees
are readily told from those of the earlier Duke, being more open and spreading,
scanter of foliage, with slender branches and with fruit more thickly
clustered along the branchlets. Ripening in a season when hybrid varieties
are gone or rapidly going, Late Duke is a valuable acquisition in the home
orchard and for nearby markets to which tender-fleshed varieties can be
shipped. If those who want late cherries will plant this variety on a northern
slope, against a northern wall or where in any way shaded or in a cool
soil, these delicious cherries can be had until well toward August. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
tree is hardy and its blossoming-time is late so that the variety is well
adapted to northern latitudes.</p>

<p>The origin of this variety is unknown. In 1797, Christ mentions
"a true English cherry" which is probably Late Duke. At least Oberdieck,
in 1861, states that the true English cherry is identical with the Late
Duke, or Anglaise Tardive. In 1823, Late Duke was introduced into
England by the London Horticultural Society from M. Vilmorin, of Paris,
under the name Anglaise Tardive. Though the French name of this
variety seems to indicate an English origin, the old English writers were
not aware of any cherry of this kind being in existence in England previous
to its introduction by the Horticultural Society. Because of the close
resemblance of Late Duke to May Duke it has often been confused with
that sort and by some writers was supposed to be a late strain of May
Duke. The American Pomological Society listed Late Duke in its fruit
catalog in 1862.</p>

</ul>

<p>This old cherry served well the needs of Americans in colonial times
when all cherries were grown from pits or suckers. Though but little
improvement on the wild <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus cerasus</i>, the trees were so hardy, vigorous,
healthy and productive that any who had a bit of spare land could have
cherries. This, therefore, became preeminently the "pie cherry" of New
England and the North Atlantic States. The trees are long-lived and even
so late as a generation ago Downing says that this variety is "better known
among us than any other acid cherry, especially abundant on the Hudson
and near New York." The variety is never planted now, having long
since been superseded by better sorts, Early Richmond and Montmorency
in particular, but it is still to be found as old trees or self-sown near where
a tree of the variety formerly stood.</p>

<p>Late Kentish and Early Richmond, the latter the Kentish of some
authors, are much confused. Late Kentish is the old Pie Cherry of Colonial
times. It is a seedling sort belonging to America, having been planted
along fences and roadsides in the earliest times. This cherry is mentioned
by the Pilgrims in 1620 and this and the May Duke were listed as market
varieties in Massachusetts. Many believe it to be a seedling of Early
Richmond, sometimes, as we have seen, called Kentish, but this variety
being two weeks later, received the name Late Kentish. The name was
put on the fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1873. The
following description is a compilation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree small, bears annually, very productive, hardy.</p>

<p>Fruit matures about two weeks after Early Richmond; medium or below in size,
roundish, flattened; stem one inch to one and one-half inches in length, stout, straight;
color deep, lively red; flesh light colored, with abundant colorless juice, very tender, sour,
remaining quite acid even when fully ripe; stone does not adhere to the stalk.

<p>It is barely possible that Lithauer, if the trees can be obtained, may
have some value in the coldest and bleakest parts of New York where
less hardy sorts cannot be grown. The variety is too poor in quality to
be worth planting where the better but less hardy cherries will grow.
We greatly doubt whether it is worthy a place in the recommended list
of fruits of the American Pomological Society. It is included here only
because of the prominence given it by a place in the fruit list named.</p>

<p>This is one of the varieties imported from Russia by Professor J. L.
Budd of Iowa, who reported that it was much grown in southwest Russia
for drying and in making cherry wine. As tested in various parts of this
country Lithauer has proved of little value except in the extreme north.
The American Pomological Society, in 1909, listed this sort in its catalog
of recommended fruits for northern fruit regions. The following
description is compiled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, vigorous, tall, weeping, hardy.</p>

<p>Fruit matures from the middle to the last of July; small, roundish, slightly oblate;
stem long, averaging one and one-half inches, slender; color dark purplish-red becoming
almost black at maturity; skin thick, tough; flesh dark red, with reddish juice, firm, meaty,
quite acid or bitter even when fully ripe; poor in quality; stone variable in size, roundish.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here again we have a very evident hybrid between some Sweet Cherry
and a Sour Cherry of the Morello type in which Morello characters are
most prominent. If the description and color-plates of this variety and
Olivet be compared it will be found that the two cherries are nearly identical.
They differ only in season of ripening and in minor tree-characters
which may be best summarized by the statement that this cherry has in
the tree more of the aspect of a Morello than has Olivet. It may be suspected
that one or the other of the two varieties on our grounds is misnamed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
but the descriptions of all who have described the two show that they
are very similar, if not identical. The history of Louis Philippe, long known
in America but little or not at all known in Europe, throws some light on the
question of its distinctness from Olivet, the origin of which is known, inasmuch
as Louis Philippe seems to be the older of the two. The value
of the two varieties to cherry-growers is the same and is indicated in the
discussion of Olivet.</p>

<p>Elliott,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> the American pomologist, imported Louis Philippe from France
in 1846 but the cherry does not seem to have been known at that time in
Europe and it is possible that Elliott gave it its name. For the first few
years the variety was not given the recognition it deserved but, in 1862,
it was recognized by the American Pomological Society by a place on its
list of recommended fruits which it still holds under the name, Philippe.</p>

</ul>

<p>For a time Lutovka and Galopin were listed as two distinct varieties.
Unquestionably they are the same despite the seeming difference in origin.
All we know of Galopin is that it was said to have been originated by a
nurseryman in Belgium whose name it bears. The Lutovka was introduced
into this country by J. L. Budd of Iowa, in 1883, and, according to the
introducer, was well known in Poland and Silesia as a roadside tree. Nothing
is said of it in foreign literature. As was the case with many of Budd's
importations, this variety did not stand the test of culture. It is a shy
bearer and is now seldom recommended, although it was placed on the
list of desirable fruits of the American Pomological Society in 1897 where
it still remains. The variety has no value in New York. In 1895, this
Station sent out buds which they had been led to believe were the Lutovka
and which they later found to be Brusseler Braune. The following
description is compiled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree large, upright, slightly spreading; leaves large, ovate, leathery, produced from
short spurs along the main branches.</p>

<p>Of the one hundred and twenty-five cherries tested on the grounds
of this Station during the past ten years, Lyons is one of the best. Though
grown for nearly a century in Europe it seems never to have been well
tried in America probably because it has not been considered particularly
valuable in the Old World. From its behavior at this Station it appears
to deserve extensive trial as an extra early market cherry for dessert
purposes, as it is one of the few tender-fleshed cherries that give promise
of standing handling for distant markets. Though commonly classed as
a hard-fleshed Bigarreau it is really an intermediate between the firm-of-flesh
cherries and the soft-fleshed Hearts. In the tree it is a typical Bigarreau.
Besides being one of the earliest of the Heart-like cherries it is one
of the largest, handsomest and best flavored. Unfortunately, because of
an accident, we cannot show a color-plate of this splendid cherry. On
these grounds the tree-characters are about all that could be desired,
though we are making allowance for a slight lack of productiveness in the
young tree which is one of the faults commonly attributed to Lyons by
European writers; however, all agree that the trees become fruitful with age.
The blossoms of this variety are conspicuously large and showy, with
pistils unusual in being longer than the stamens. The merits of Lyons
have been so pronounced in the several years we have watched it that we
feel quite warranted in recommending it for both home and commercial
orchards.</p>

<p>About 1822, M. Jaboulay, a nurseryman at Oullins, near Lyons, France,
grafted over a number of seedling cherries which had sprung up on his
grounds. Five years later, having decided to dig out the trees, he was
attracted by the superb growth made by one of them upon which the graft
had not started and ordered the tree to be saved. This tree produced a
full crop of exceedingly large and attractive fruit which matured far in
advance of other varieties. Jaboulay decided to save all the grafts for
propagation the succeeding year but found upon going to the tree the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
spring that the wood had been stolen. About five years later M.
Riviére, also a nurseryman at Oullins, placed upon the market at Lyons
a very early cherry which he called Bigarreau Anglaise but which was recognized
as the same as the one found by Jaboulay. Thus have come the
several names given in the synonyms. Lyons has never been much grown
in this country. Lewis B. Eaton of Buffalo, New York, in importing
cherry trees from France in 1841 and 1842, found among them one without
a label which turned out to be Bigarreau de Lyon, later the Lyons. Trees
of this variety were received for testing at this Station from the United
States Department of Agriculture under the name Hâtive de Lyons.
These, as grown here, have proved identical in both tree and fruit characters
with the many descriptions of Bigarreau Jaboulay, or Bigarreau de
Lyon.</p>

<p>This good, old cherry has never been considered a commercial fruit
in the United States; yet it is, and has been, surprisingly popular with nurserymen,
most of whom for nearly a century have offered it for sale. A
generation ago, when American fruit-growing was in the hands of connoisseurs,
Magnifique was more popular than now. It has failed as a
commercial cherry because the crop ripens very unevenly, there being
sometimes green and fully ripe cherries on the tree at the same time, though
the season is usually given as very late. This is one of the lightest in
color of the hybrid Dukes, the Sour Cherry parent very evidently having
been an Amarelle&mdash;a conclusion to which both fruit and tree point. The
quality is usually counted as very good though it is too acid to be a first-rate
dessert cherry for some. The trees are very vigorous and usually
are fruitful. Magnifique has been grown so long that its place in the
orchard would seem to have been fixed by experience; yet it might be made
more than a cherry for the home orchard if some commercial grower would
plant it in a shaded place and a cool soil and thereby retard ripening time
until other cherries were gone.</p>

<p>This valuable cherry was brought to notice in 1795 by Chatenay,
surnamed Magnifique, a nurseryman near Paris. It seems, at first, to
have been quite commonly called Belle de Chatenay but Belle de Magnifique
became the commoner appellation ending in America at least with
the universal name "Belle Magnifique." The variety was introduced
into America from France sometime before 1830, by General H. A. S.
Dearborn, Boston, Massachusetts, President of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. The cherry is typically a Duke sort and is so listed by
most writers, though Downing in 1845 placed it with the Morello cherries.
Magnifique was placed upon the fruit list of the American Pomological
Society in 1852 where it has since remained.

<p>May Duke is one of the oldest and, the world over, one of the most
popular cherries. There are several reasons why it has attained and holds
its popularity. It is finely flavored, especially when prepared for the table,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
and even before ripe; it is also delicious to eat out of hand if the cherries
are dead ripe, when it is one of the best of the subacid cherries; while one
of the earliest of its class, it may be left to hang for a month or six weeks,
becoming daily sweeter and more aromatic; few or no cherries thrive in
greater variations of soil and climates, this fact accounting in greatest
measure for its world-wide distribution in temperate regions; despite its
tender flesh, it ships well though it is grown only for local markets since
its long period of ripening makes necessary several pickings&mdash;a fatal
defect for a canning cherry or one for the general trade; lastly, the trees are
as fruitful as any, and are hardy, vigorous and healthy. The fruit is remarkably
well distributed in dense clusters on trees characteristically upright
and vasiform and bearing a heavy canopy of dark green, luxuriant foliage.
May Duke fills a particular place in the cherry orchard as a fruit for the
local market and hundreds of new-comers have not been able to supplant
it. The fact that it has lost none of its pristine vigor, health and productiveness
in the two hundred and more years it has been known contradicts
the idea that varieties of fruit degenerate or wear out with age. When
we pass in review all of the varieties of cherries, all characters and purposes
considered, May Duke remains one of the best.</p>

<p>This variety seems to have been first mentioned by Ray in 1688.
May Duke is supposed by some English writers to have originated in a
district in France known as Médoc and the name to have been derived
from the place. When this cherry first received attention, the old style
of reckoning time was in vogue and the 11th of June was the last day of
May. It may, therefore, be presumed that the variety derived its name
from its season of ripening rather than from a corruption of Médoc. A
few years ago Professor J. L. Budd of Iowa imported from Russia several
cherries among which was one called Esel Kirsche. Later this cherry was
distributed by the United States Department of Agriculture. As grown
on the grounds of this Station, Esel Kirsche has proved to be May Duke.
In Ohio the two could not be distinguished and with this evidence we have
listed Esel Kirsche as a synonym of May Duke. In 1832, William Prince
mentioned May Duke as being among the first of the cherries introduced
to America from Europe. From the references to this variety in the horticultural
literature and in the nursery catalogs throughout the United
States we may say that it is one of the most widely distributed and best-known
cherries in the country. The American Pomological Society placed
May Duke on its fruit catalog list in 1848.

<p>This comparatively new Bigarreau is on probation in many parts of
the State and country, otherwise we should not give it prominence in
<cite>The Cherries of New York</cite>, as the variety is all but worthless as it grows
on the grounds of this Station. The trees are not sufficiently fruitful, the
cherries are too small, the flavor in none too good and the fruit is not at all
resistant to brown-rot&mdash;four fatal defects for a commercial cherry.</p>

<p>This variety is reported to have sprung from a pit of a Mazzard tree
and was introduced several years ago by Black &amp; Son of Hightstown, New
Jersey. The name, Mercer, after the county in New Jersey from which
it was introduced, was given the cherry by H. E. Van Deman, then United
States Pomologist.

<p>Mezel seems to have made a stir in pomological circles in the middle of
the Nineteenth Century by reason of the great size and beautiful appearance
of the cherries. Though on the recommended list of the American Pomological
Society and frequently spoken of in the pomological works of the day and
offered by some nurserymen, we have not been able to find many trees of
this variety now growing in New York. We glean from the literature
that Mezel pleased the eye more than the palate and that the trees, while
vigorous and healthy, were not productive. At any rate after a decade or
two of much advertising and what would seem to have been a very thorough
trial, Mezel failed to receive very general approbation from cherry-growers
and has now almost passed from cultivation. Contrary to the general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
behavior of the variety in New York, the tree and fruit from which the
accompanying description was made have so many merits that one can well
wish that the variety will not wholly pass out of cultivation.</p>

<p>This variety was found at Mezel, Puy-de-Dôme, France, by M. Ligier
sometime prior to 1846 when it was brought to notice. Even so, it had
grown in a vineyard at that place for thirty years and was only made public
after an excursion of several members of a horticultural society to the
vineyard. It was immediately heralded as a coming variety and grafts
were distributed. Great Bigarreau, which made its appearance a few
years later, is here included as a synonym though many writers list it as
a distinct sort. Bigarreau Monstrueux, first listed in the London Horticultural
Society catalog for 1831, is held by many pomologists to be identical
with Mezel which, if true, casts some doubt on the generally accepted history
of the variety. Mezel appeared on the fruit list of the American Pomological
Society in 1862 but was discarded in 1869; it was replaced in 1883
and is still on the list though it is scarcely known in any part of the United
States.</p>

<p>Montmorency is the most popular Sour Cherry grown in America.
No one questions its supremacy. Probably half of the cherry trees in
New York, Sweet or Sour, are Montmorencies and at least three-fourths
of all the trees of the Sour Cherry are of this variety. It leads in the
demands for this fruit in the markets, for the cannery and for home use as a
culinary cherry. Several characters give it first place. It is surpassed
by no other Sour Cherry, in New York at least, in vigor, health and productiveness
of tree. In the last character, in particular, it is supreme.
Year in and year out, Montmorency trees are fruitful. Possibly, too, no other
Sour Cherry is adapted to a greater diversity of soils than Montmorency,
which, with capacity to stand heat and cold, makes the variety suitable
to wide variations in environment. The cherries are in no way remarkable&mdash;not
much above the average for an Amarelle in size, appearance or
quality, in all of these characters being much inferior to Large Montmorency.
The fruit has the advantage of being presentable in appearance
and fit for culinary purposes several days before it is fully ripe and this
adds to the value of the variety for the market. Brown-rot takes less
toll from this cherry than of others of its kind probably because of relatively
firm flesh and thick skin. These characters, also, make the fruit
stand handling well in harvesting, shipping and on the markets. The
preserved product, whether canned at home or commercially, is attractive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
in appearance and very good. Montmorency is not a dessert cherry but
for those who like Sour Cherries it may be eaten out of hand with relish
when it is fully matured. Some maintain that the variety falls short in
the size of the tree, which is seldom more than medium, but the head is
spreading and much-branched and the fruit is borne in clusters thickly
scattered throughout the whole head so that the total yield from a tree is
greater than would be thought from its size. For any and all purposes
to which Sour Cherries are put Montmorency may be recommended as
the best in its season.</p>

<p>Unfortunately several quite distinct cherries bear the name Montmorency
and it has been most difficult to separate them in pomological
literature. To make matters worse, all of them have been much confused
with other varieties, Early Richmond in particular. The different Montmorencies
and Early Richmond originated in the Montmorency Valley,
France, several centuries ago, at least before the Seventeenth Century,
probably as seedlings of Cerise Hâtive or of Cerise Commune. These Montmorency
cherries differ from each other principally in their stems and fruit,
one having long stems and moderate-sized, regular fruit; one shorter stems
and larger fruit; and the third, very short, thick stems and oblate, irregular
fruit showing a distinct suture. The first cherry has been generally known,
particularly among the French, as Montmorency à Longue Queue or sometimes
Cerise de Montmorency. This is the Montmorency of this sketch.
Duhamel, in 1768, was the first writer to mention this cherry directly and
according to his statement it was then esteemed around Paris, being superior
in productiveness to the Large Montmorency.</p>

<p>Montmorency early found its way into England, where it soon became
confused with its probable parent, the French Cerise Hâtive or the English
Kentish. In a short time it had replaced Kentish in many nurseries and
came to be called Kentish in much of the literature of the time. Just
when Montmorency was introduced to this country is not known but it
has been cultivated here under various names for many years. William
Prince spoke of it in 1832 as the Long Stem Montmorency and it has long
and commonly been known here as Montmorency Ordinaire. Montmorency
is to be found in nearly every nursery in the United States under
various names, some nurserymen using the French name, others the English,
while still others are selling the variety as Large Montmorency. Many
supposed strains have been given new names but it is doubtful if any distinct
strains of this cherry exist. The American Pomological Society added
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Montmorency to its fruit catalog list in 1897 using the qualifying term
Ordinaire which was dropped in 1909.</p>

<p>Napoleon is the leading firm-fleshed Sweet Cherry. It takes its place
by virtue of the large size, handsome appearance and high quality of the
fruit and the phenomenal productiveness of the trees. The accompanying
plate shows well the large size and beautiful color of the cherries&mdash;unsurpassed
in either character by any other Bigarreau and possibly by any
other cherry. The flavor is rich and sweet which, with the abundant
juice and firm, crackling flesh, makes this a most delicious and refreshing
cherry for dessert and, with the great size and attractive color, gives it
preference over all other Sweet Cherries for culinary purposes. In particular,
cherry-canners find that Napoleon makes a finely finished product.
The cherries carry well and keep long and are, therefore, well thought of
by fruit-dealers. Besides being very productive, the trees come in bearing
early and are as vigorous, hardy and healthy as those of any other Sweet
Cherry. They may usually be known by their upright growth and large,
sturdy limbs. Napoleon, however, is not without its faults. The cherries
crack badly in wet weather and the variety can be grown with certainty
only in the dry summer climate of the Pacific Coast, where, especially in
Oregon and Washington, it reaches truly wonderful perfection. In the
East, too, Napoleon is more susceptible to brown-rot than several of its
rivals. Possibly the greatest fault, however, is in the tree, which is very
fastidious as to soils, thriving only in choice cherry land and in a congenial
cherry climate. Despite these rather serious faults, cherry-growers agree
that Napoleon takes first place among Sweet Cherries for both home and
commercial plantings.</p>

<p>Napoleon is of unknown origin. Early in the Eighteenth Century
it was grown by the Germans, French, Dutch and English, proof that it
is a very old variety. Leroy believes that it was described by Merlet in
1667 but under another name. The great number of synonyms in several
languages gives some idea of the countries in which the variety has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
grown as well as the esteem in which it has been held. There are several
accounts as to when the cherry was given the name Napoleon. Probably
the best authenticated is that in which it is held that Parmentier, a Belgian,
gave the cherry the name of the famous emperor in 1820. When
the variety was taken to England, where at that time Napoleon was
not in good repute, the name of his conqueror, Wellington, was substituted
but seems to have been little used. As if not content with the
score or more of European names, cherry-growers in America have added
at least two more. In many parts of the country it is locally called the
Ox Heart. On the Pacific Coast it is grown and sold by nurserymen and
fruit-growers alike as Royal Ann, a name given it by its introducer, Seth
Lewelling, of Milwaukee, Oregon, who lost the label bearing the old name
in taking it across the Continent in early days and gave it a new name.
With incomprehensible persistency Western horticulturists maintain this
synonym to the confusion of horticultural nomenclature. The American
Pomological Society placed Napoleon on its fruit list in 1862, it having
been grown in America for at least 40 years before receiving this honor.</p>

<p>If this cherry were to be judged by its behavior on the grounds of this
Station, it would be called one of the best of the hybrid Dukes. In particular,
it would be commended by its product, the trees not making as good
a showing as the fruit. The cherries are distinguished by their large size,
dark red color, glossy surface, good quality, lateness in maturity and,
even more particularly, sweetness, keeping in mind that the variety is a
hybrid and not a true Sweet Cherry. The shape, too, offers a distinguishing
character, the fruits being more oblate than in any other Duke.
The long, stout stem is still another characteristic. Unfortunately the
tree, while satisfactory in all other respects, is unproductive&mdash;a fatal fault in
these days of commercial fruit-growing. Nouvelle Royale is not widely known
in America and may well be given trial by those who want a late Duke.</p>

<p>This variety is supposed from its fruit- and tree-characters to be a hybrid
between Early Richmond and May Duke but where, how and when it
came to light is not known. Downing, in 1869, mentions the Nouvelle
Royale as having recently been introduced into this country and it was
noted in the Report of the American Pomological Society for 1875 but
has never received a place upon the Society's fruit catalog list.</p>

<p>Olivet is a large, globular, deep red, glossy cherry with a rich, vinous,
subacid flavor. Some writers call Olivet a Duke while others place it
with the Morellos. The fruit, on the grounds of this Station, shows many
characteristics of the Morellos while the tree appears to be a Duke, suggesting
that it is a hybrid between trees of the two groups. The fruit,
eaten out of hand, would be rated as a very good Morello or a subacid
and somewhat mediocre Duke, a fruit hardly good enough for dessert and
not as good as some of the sourer cherries for culinary purposes. It is
one of the earliest of the Morello-like cherries and this may give it a place
in the cherry flora of the country. The trees are large and vigorous and
their much-branched, round tops would seem to give the maximum amount
of bearing surface, but, unfortunately, the cherries do not set abundantly.
On the grounds of this Station the variety is not fruitful, this being its chief
defect. In other parts of the country, however, it is reported to be either
very productive or moderately so. The descriptions of this cherry as given
by American experiment stations and nurserymen show plainly that there
are several distinct sorts passing under the name Olivet in this country.</p>

<p>Olivet, of comparatively recent origin, was found at Olivet, Loire,
France. American nurserymen introduced this variety sometime previous
to 1877, for in that year the <cite>Gardener's Monthly</cite> mentioned the cherry as
being "a valuable Duke sort filling an unoccupied place among the list
of early cherries in central New York." Olivet was entered on the American
Pomological Society's catalog list of fruits in 1881 where it is still
retained.</p>

<p>Ostheim finds considerable favor in the prairie states of the Middle
West but is all but worthless as grown in New York and other eastern
states. It is one of the Morellos and falls far short of the best of its group,
the cherries being too small and of but mediocre quality. The trees are
typical Morellos, round-headed, with slender, drooping branches and branchlets
and very dark green foliage. The fruit is borne toward the ends of
short branches which are not well distributed over the main branches,
leaving much bare wood. Like all Morellos the fruit hangs long after
maturity and since the ripening season is late the variety may be worth
growing because of its lateness; as it may, also, in cold climates because
of great hardiness. The trees on their own roots throw up many suckers
which are often used in propagation. The variety has the reputation,
too, of coming true to name from seeds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>Ostheim is a native of Spain and not of Germany as many have
supposed. The trees were found in the region of the Sierra Morena Mountains,
Spain, and were taken to Germany by a Dr. Klinghammer after the
Wars of the Succession, 1701-1713. The cherry took the name Ostheim from
the German town of that name where it was widely grown. The variety,
being easily propagated, spread throughout Germany and soon became
one of the best-known cherries. Later, the name seems to have come to
be a class term for all cherries similar to the original Ostheim. The names
Ostheim, Ostheimer, Griotte Ostheim and Ostheimer Weichsel are used
interchangeably by foreign writers for this variety. American writers,
however, have given these names to two very similar but distinct varieties.
Ostheim was brought to the United States by William Robert Prince of
the Linnean Botanical Gardens early in the Nineteenth Century. It
has proved very satisfactory in some sections of the West and Canada,
while in the East it is but a mediocre variety at best. At different times
either buds or trees of so-called Ostheims have been imported to this
country which have turned out not to be the true variety. What these
sorts really are will remain uncertain until the several forms can be brought
together and compared. Professor Budd imported a variety in 1883,
which since has become known as Ostheim, carrying Griotte d'Ostheim
as a synonym. Whether or not this is the old variety or a distinct strain
of the Ostheim class we are unable to say. The Cerise d'Ostheim received
by this Station has proved identical with this variety. Ostheim was first
listed by the American Pomological Society in 1899. A cherry known
as Minnesota Ostheim, introduced into Minnesota from Germany, is now
recognized as a distinct sort. The variety as it is known in Kansas
and Missouri is often called the German Ostheimer though some believe
this to be different from the true sort.</p>

<p>Ox Heart is very commonly used as a class name for the large, meaty
varieties of cherries which are cordate in shape. In America the name is
most often given to the light-fleshed cherries, such as Yellow Spanish,
Napoleon or White Bigarreau. At one time, however, the name was
applied to a distinct variety known throughout England, Germany and
America, being first mentioned by Miller, an Englishman, in 1734. Coxe,
in 1817, was the first American writer to list the variety but it never
became popular in the New World. Ox Heart appeared among the fruits
rejected by the American Pomological Society in 1858 and from then on
it gradually gave way to better varieties. The synonyms of the true Ox
Heart are badly confused not only with other dark-fleshed varieties but
with those of the Yellow Spanish type. As some of these varieties are
merely listed while others have but a meager description, it is impossible
to separate or group them with any degree of certainty. In the 1909
catalog of the American Pomological Society there appears an Ox Heart
of American origin and of recent introduction, known in the West as Major
Francis. There are also in several nursery catalogs a "white-fleshed Ox
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Heart." What this variety is we are unable to say. The following is a
description of Ox Heart compiled from European fruit books:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree medium in vigor, round-topped, spherical, productive; branches somewhat
curved; internodes of medium length; leaves obovate, obtusely pointed, margin finely
serrate; petiole short, rather slender, flexible, tinged red, with two reniform glands; flowers
small; petals irregularly elliptical.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the last of June or early in July; medium to large, cordate, pointed,
sides unevenly compressed; color lively red changing to intense purple or nearly black;
stem of medium length and thickness, usually tinged red, inserted in a broad, deep cavity;
skin tough; flesh dark red, with abundant colored juice, half-tender but firmer than most
Hearts, sweet though slightly bitter before complete maturity; quality good; stone medium
in size, broadly cordate, adhering to the flesh along the ventral suture.</p></blockquote>

<p>Were there not so many good Duke varieties of its season Reine Hortense
would take high rank among hybrid cherries. Several qualities fit
it admirably for home and somewhat for commercial plantations. To
begin with, it is most excellent in quality, its flavor being a commingling
of the refreshing acidity of the Sour Cherry and the richness of the Sweet
Cherry, though to some there may be a little too much acidity for a first-class
dessert fruit. The cherries are also handsome&mdash;large, round, bright,
glossy red with a shade of amber and very uniform in size, color and
shape. The fruit is especially attractive on the tree as it hangs on long
stems in twos and threes thickly scattered and never much clustered.
Unfortunately the fruit does not stand handling in harvesting and marketing
quite as well as that of some other Dukes and is a little too susceptible to
brown-rot for a good commercial cherry. The chief faults of the variety,
however, are in the trees rather than in the fruit. The trees are but of
medium size, are not as productive as some others of the hybrid sorts, are
at their best only in choice cherry soils and demand good care. In Europe,
Reine Hortense is much used as a dwarf and for training on walls. It
would seem that its merits and faults, as it grows in America, are such as
fit it preeminently well only for the amateur.</p>

<p>Of the several accounts of the origin of Reine Hortense the one giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
France as its home and Larose as its originator is here accepted as authentic.
M. Larose of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Seine, a gardener of the imperial court,
grew the original tree early in the Nineteenth Century from a seed of the
Cerise Larose, a seedling of his introduction. Soon after the first mention
of this variety, about 1841, there appeared the Louis XVIII, Morestin,
Guigne de Petit-Brie and several others. The variety was seemingly
rechristened by every nurseryman who got hold of it. At one time the
name Monstreuse de Bavay was acceptable to many, it having been given
to the variety by a Mr. Bavay of Vilvorde, Brabant, Belgium, about 1826.
The theory that Reine Hortense comes true to seed and therefore has
several strains has been discredited. The American Pomological Society
recognized Reine Hortense in 1856, only a few years after being introduced
into this country, by placing it on the recommended fruit list. In
1909, the Society shortened the name from Reine Hortense to Hortense
but in this text we prefer to use the full name, thereby indicating clearly
the person for whom the cherry was christened.</p>

<p>For some reason Republican does not make headway in the favor
of cherry-growers though all who have described it speak well of it. Judged
by the palate, Republican is one of the best of the Bigarreaus. The cherries
are rich and sweet in flavor, firm of flesh and with an abundance of
refreshing juice. Judged by the eye, too, it holds its own with the best of
its class, the fruit having a pleasing rotundness of shape and a beautiful
dark red, almost black, glossy color. In size the variety very often falls
short; for, though often given as one of the largest, it turns out to be, in
many orchards, but of medium size and sometimes is small. Here seems
to be its fatal defect. It is exceedingly capricious as to soils, failing wholly
or in part in all but the very choicest cherry environments. The trees
are large, spreading and vigorous but on the grounds of this Station are
more susceptible to the shot-hole fungus than any other Sweet Cherry.
It has been reported to be very subject to this disease at the Washington
Station also. The failure of this cherry to meet the demands of commercial
cherry-growers during a probationary period of nearly a half a century
means that it is, at most, of but local value.</p>

<p>This variety, known under two other names, Black Republican and
Lewelling, originated about the middle of the Nineteenth Century in the
orchard of Seth Lewelling, Milwaukee, Oregon. In traveling across the
continent in 1849, Mr. Lewelling took with him to Oregon, Bigarreau,
Morello and Mahaleb cherries and from seeds of one of the Bigarreaus
sprang several seedlings, among them one which was named Black
Republican. The parentage of the sort is not known though it was thought
to be a cross between Napoleon and Black Tartarian, having sprung
up near these two trees. Some cherry-growers and nurserymen describe
a cherry which they call Lewelling but in every case the descriptions agree
very closely with Republican. Many list the two names separately as
designating two distinct varieties of diverse origin. Of these, some have
supposed Republican to be a seedling of Eagle originating in 1860. The
American Pomological Society for many years listed Black Republican
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
alone beginning in its catalog of 1875 but in 1909 the catalog contained
the two names, Republican and Lewelling. Inasmuch as the consensus
of opinion is that both names apply to a single cherry this Station has
decided to list Republican only.</p>

<p>Rockport is of very doubtful commercial value and has too many
faults to be included with the best sweet sorts for a home orchard. It
is more easily characterized by its faults than its merits. Compared
with the well-known Yellow Spanish, of which it is a seedling and to which
it is similar, the cherries are smaller and the pits are larger than those of
the parent variety,&mdash;quite too large for the amount of pulp. Worst of
the faults of the variety is, however, that the cherries are not sufficiently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
firm of flesh to withstand harvesting, shipping and the attacks of the
brown-rot fungus. To offset the defects of the fruit the flesh is rich, sweet
and tender, making it, all in all, as good as any other Sweet Cherry for
dessert. The trees, too, are very satisfactory, being large, vigorous and
very fruitful, though with the reputation of requiring good soil and the
best of care, of lacking a little in hardiness to cold, and of having the period
of maturing the crop more or less changed by soil and culture. Rockport
has been, and is, more or less popular in New York but it can be recommended
only for a home orchard.</p>

<p>Rockport is another of Professor Kirtland's introductions, having been
raised by him at Cleveland, Ohio, about 1842, from a seed of Yellow Spanish.
It soon won a place, in 1862, on the fruit list of the American Pomological
Society where it still remains. It is mentioned by several foreign authors
and many American nurserymen offer it for sale. Swedish is given as a
synonym of Rockport by Hooper.</p>

<p>Royal Duke has a place in the cherry flora to follow in season the
well-known May Duke and to precede another standard sort, Late Duke.
It is so nearly like these two sorts, except in season, and so similar to Arch
Duke, as well, that there is much difficulty in getting the variety true
to name. It is more often taken for May Duke than for the other kinds
named but it differs from this well-known sort in being a little later in
season, and the cherries are larger, a little lighter in color, do not hang as
thickly, being scattered along the branches, often singly, and are more
oblate. The trees are markedly upright and the foliage is very dense.
None of the Dukes are popular in America for market fruits and this is
no exception though, among all, Royal Duke is as good as any&mdash;pleasantly
flavored, juicy, refreshing and very good. The trees, too, are very satisfactory.
The variety has a place in home orchards and for local markets.
The French say that the tree makes a very weak growth budded on the
Mahaleb and that it should be worked on the Mazzard, which is generally
true of all Dukes. The buyer will have difficulty in getting the true Royal
Duke in America.</p>

<p>The origin of this variety is unknown but the Royale d'Angleterre,
mentioned by Christ in 1791, was probably the variety now known as
Royal Duke, although the description is too meager to be certain.
According to Thompson, Royal Duke was one of the varieties formerly cultivated
in England under the names Late Duke, Arch Duke, or Late Arch
Duke and was probably introduced by the London Horticultural Society
from France under the name of Anglaise Tardive. When or by whom
this variety was introduced into America is not known but according to
Downing it was very rarely found here in the first half of the Nineteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Century. The American Pomological Society placed Royal Duke upon
its catalog list of recommended fruits in 1871.</p>

<p>Schmidt, shortened in accordance with the rules of the American
Pomological Society from Schmidt's Bigarreau, is not new nor can it be
said to be little known, since it has been rather widely planted in America
for a score of years. Yet in New York, at least, it is not receiving the
attention that it deserves from commercial cherry-growers, being relegated
to the rear of ten or a dozen kinds when it should be in the front rank.
Indeed, about Geneva, where many Sweet Cherries are grown, while not
the leading market variety, it is one of the best. The characters which
entitle it to a high place as a money-maker are: large size, being unsurpassed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
in this respect by any other black cherry in this region; its round, plump
form and glossy, black color which tempt the eye; crisp, firm, juicy flesh
and sweet, rich flavor, delicious to the taste; dark ruby-red color under
the skin which makes it as pleasing inwardly as outwardly; freedom from
brown-rot, in this respect excelling any other market sort; and a vigorous,
healthy, productive tree. The tree is further characterized by its abundant,
large leaves of dark, luxuriant green. The fruit is often picked before
it is ripe, at which time it is dark red and not black. There is a good
deal of enthusiasm in New York over several new Sweet Cherries from
the Pacific Coast but in this vicinity none of these is equal to Schmidt.</p>

<p>Schmidt is a seedling of Festfleischige Schwarze Knorpelkirsche and
was raised by Herr Schmidt, Forester at Casekow, Prussia, Germany,
about 1841. It was introduced into England by Thomas Rivers of Sawbridgeworth
and eventually found its way to America but how and when
is not known. Schmidt appeared on the fruit list of the American Pomological
Society in 1897 but only for two years when for some reason it was
dropped. In 1909, a Smith was listed, with Smith's Bigarreau as a synonym.
Budd-Hansen in the publication of 1903 also mentioned a Smith which is
probably Schmidt. We are inclined to hold to the German spelling, Schmidt.</p>

<p>In tracing the history of the Montmorency cherries from Duhamel's
time to the present we have been led to conclude that three distinct types
are now being cultivated. Of these closely related strains, all of which
probably originated about the same time in Montmorency Valley, France,
Montmorency is by far the most important and the one now grown commercially
in all parts of the country. Large Montmorency, while quite
similar to Montmorency, is much less grown because of its unproductiveness,
although in quality it is quite equal or perhaps superior to Montmorency.
Short-Stem Montmorency, under discussion here, varies considerably
both in tree and fruit from either of the other two, although
it is frequently taken for Large Montmorency. The tree is smaller and
more drooping but usually very productive. The fruit, similar in size to
Large Montmorency, differs from it by being more oblate and irregular,
and in having a very deep, wide suture which becomes an indistinct line
towards the apex. The skin seldom becomes as dark red even at perfect
maturity. The flavor is more sprightly but its quality is not as high.
All three varieties have long lists of synonyms, many of which have been
used for each of the three sorts. Many writers believe that only two
distinct strains of Montmorency exist and that Short-Stem Montmorency
is identical with Large Montmorency. The variety is little grown in
North America and is not as worthy for any purpose as either of the other
two better-known sorts.</p>

<p>Sklanka is evidently a cross between a cherry of the Amarelle group
and one of the Morellos&mdash;another indication of the frequency of hybridization
in this fruit. The cherries of Sklanka have the light-colored skin
and juice of the Amarelles while the dwarfish, round-topped trees with
pendant branches and abundant, small leaves are typical of the Morellos.
The variety is in no way remarkable unless it be in hardiness, the pomologists
of the colder parts of the Mississippi Valley holding that it is one
of the hardiest of cherries. The fruit is not on a par with that of a score
of other Amarelles and the trees, in New York at least, are too small and
unproductive to be worth planting. The cherry has value, then, only
where hardiness is a prime requisite.</p>

<p>Sklanka was imported to this country from Russia in 1883 by Professor
J. L. Budd of Ames, Iowa. Its parentage and origin are uncertain.
It does not seem to have been grown in continental Europe outside of
Russia but in certain sections of that country it is reported as being one
of the hardiest and most productive of the Sour Cherries. As grown in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
our Northern Central States it has proved one of the hardiest of all varieties
but has not, as yet, gained much reputation commercially even in these
cold regions. It is mentioned but seldom in the literature and is listed by
but few nurserymen.</p>

<p>Sparhawk has little to recommend it for either a home or commercial
orchard; but the rich and honeyed sweetness of the cherries, scarcely surpassed
in flavor, might make it worth planting by plant-breeders and
connoisseurs of choicely good fruits. The name "honey" which appears
in several of the synonyms is indicative of the flavor of the fruit. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
cherries are quite too small and the pits altogether too large for a commercial
product. The tree is upright-spreading, with numerous thick
branches over which the cherries are rather thickly scattered in ones, twos
and threes and never in clusters. The fruit-stems are characteristically
long and slender. Though of the Bigarreau group the flesh is too tender
to well withstand harvesting, shipping and the brown-rot.</p>

<p>This cherry was introduced by Edward Sparhawk, for whom it was
named, of Brighton, Massachusetts. The variety has been known under
a number of different names, the number being no measure of its merit,
however, for it has never been extensively cultivated. The American
Pomological Society placed it in its fruit catalog list of recommended
varieties in 1862 but dropped it in 1871 and for many years but little
attention has been given it. It is now for sale in but few of the nurseries
of the country.</p>

<p>This is another variety with Amarelle fruit and a Morello-like tree
and is unquestionably a hybrid between varieties of the two groups. Several
references from the Middle West mention Späte Amarelle as very
promising but in New York, where such sorts as Early Richmond and
the Montmorencies thrive, it is unpromising for any purpose. The cherries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
are quite too poor in quality, being very sour, and the trees too unproductive
to make the variety even a poor rival of a score or more of Amarelles
and Dukes with which it would have to compete in this State.</p>

<p>The origin of this cherry is unknown but according to Truchsess it
was sent out from Hanover as Späte Morelle in 1785. In 1797, Christ
mentions a cherry under this name the description of which agrees with
that of Späte Amarelle. Lauche states that Truchsess received the variety
from Hanover under the name Späte Morelle and later changed the name
to Späte Amarelle. This cherry was grown in the Paris National Nursery
under the name Cerise Amarelle Tardive and at one time was commonly
grown in gardens in France. In the spring of 1883, Professor J. L.
Budd of Iowa brought to America a large number of cherries from central
and eastern Europe. Somehow there was confusion in the description
of these imported cherries and two kinds were described under the name
Späte Amarelle, one a light-fleshed sort, the other with red flesh and colored
juice. The true variety has light flesh and juice and a pleasant, acid flavor
and is probably identical with the old French sort, Cerise Amarelle Tardive.
The cherry sometimes called Späte Morello can be no other than
the Späte Amarelle.</p>

<p>Suda has been widely advertised as an improved English Morello but,
while there seem to be some slight differences between the two, the new
variety is not an improvement on the old so far as can be discovered at
this Station. The trees of Suda in general aspect are more upright and
the stems of the cherries longer and more slender than those of English
Morello, being but an inch in length in the one variety and an inch and three-fourths
in the other. The trees on the grounds of this Station are not as
productive as those of English Morello. The cherries, if anything, are
not as high in quality as those of the older and probably the parent variety.
It is doubtful if there is a place for Suda in the cherry industry of New York.</p>

<p>This cherry originated in the garden of a Captain Suda, Louisiana,
Missouri, about 1880. The American Pomological Society listed Suda in
its fruit catalog of 1899 as Suda Hardy but in 1909 shortened the name
to Suda, a change which has generally been accepted.</p>

<p>Timme can hardly be distinguished from Early Richmond, differing
only in smaller fruits, and probably is a seed variation of that variety.
On the grounds of this Station the trees of Timme are even more productive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
than those of Early Richmond, one of the most fruitful of all cherries,
but the greater fruitfulness of the tree hardly offsets the smaller size of
the cherries. It is doubtful if this new strain can displace the older Early
Richmond, which is well established in the favor of cherry-growers
everywhere.</p>

<p>This variety is supposed to have been brought to America from Germany
by a Mr. Timme of Omaha, Nebraska. It is of some local importance
in Iowa and Nebraska but as yet has not been widely distributed in America.
Possibly it will be found in time that it is some old German variety
renamed. It was placed on the fruit list of the American Pomological
Society in 1909.</p>

<p>Toussaint is a marked deviation from its species. Instead of bearing
blossoms normally this variety sends out small branches from the buds.
In the axis of the first four leaves are borne the buds destined to produce
similar branches the following spring. As the branches elongate these
buds remain dormant but others are borne which produce flowers in umbel-like
clusters of two or three. The trees begin blooming three or four weeks
later than other cherries and new buds and flowers appear continually
until August or thereabouts. The tree, too, is most striking in appearance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
being dwarfish in stature, thickly set with pendant branchlets and, all in
all, attractive enough to make it a rather handsome ornamental. The
cherries are of little or no value, being quite too acid to eat out of hand
but furnishing very late fruit which may be used for culinary purposes.
The description given is compiled.</p>

<p>The history of the variety is uncertain. Leroy says that it was mentioned
by Daléchamp, a French writer, as early as 1586. Duhamel seems
to have been the first pomologist to describe it which he did in 1768 under
the name Cerisier de la Toussaint. The variety is well known in Europe,
being widely distributed in Austria, Germany, Belgium, France and England,
pomologists and nurserymen in all these countries seeming to be
well acquainted with it. There are no records of its culture in America,
although Prince and Elliott describe it from European fruit books.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree small, hardy, moderately productive; branches slender, numerous, pendant.</p>

<p>Fruit small, flattened on the ends and sides; stem long; color clear red, darker on
maturing, rather transparent; flesh white somewhat red at the center, with reddish juice;
flavor, if mature, sour, though not excellent; stone large, long, clings to the flesh more
than to the stem. The fruit borne in October never reaches maturity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vladimir is a Morello-like cherry not more promising in New York,
at least in the orchard of this Station, than any other of the many competitors
of English Morello. The cherries are large, very similar in size
and appearance to those of English Morello; the pit is small, the skin very
thin and separating readily from the pulp. The variety is further characterized
by the very dark red flesh and dark colored juice which is too
astringent and sour to eat out of hand but does very well for culinary
purposes. The tree is much like that of English Morello but is far more
dwarfish and not as productive, these being fatal faults for commercial
planting in New York. It falls short of English Morello in another respect&mdash;the
fruit ripens very unevenly. Vladimir has the reputation of being
one of the hardiest of all cherries. It is said to come true from seed and
does better on its own roots than on either Mazzard or Mahaleb. The
Russians, according to Budd, succeed best with it when it is propagated
from sprouts and allowed to form a bushy plant with several stems, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
oldest of which are cut from time to time. There seems to be little in the
variety to commend it for either home or commercial plantings in New
York.</p>

<p>Vladimir is a generic name for a group of varieties grown in Russia,
principally in the province of Vladimir east of Moscow. Most of these
cherries are large, black fruits with highly colored juice and good quality,
much valued for market use in their native country. Professor J. L. Budd
imported a number of these Vladimir cherries from Orel in Central Russia
and grew them at the Experiment Station grounds in Iowa, giving to each
a seedling number as a distinguishing characteristic. One, Orel No. 25,
was selected as being superior in many respects to the others and was
finally named Vladimir. This variety, typical of these Russian cherries,
has been considerably propagated and is generally distributed throughout
this country. The American Pomological Society added Vladimir to its
list of recommended fruits in 1909.</p>

<p>This old sort, seemingly well thought of in Europe, has not been
popular in America and has only historical value to cherry-growers of this
country. It is an interesting cherry resembling the Bigarreaus in tree and
leaf-characters while the flowers are more like those of the Dukes, the
fruit, too, taking on more the aspect of the Dukes than of the Sweet
Cherry. The variety has long since passed from general cultivation in the
United States and can now be found only in collections or as an occasional
dooryard tree.</p>

<p>This cherry was raised early in the Nineteenth Century by T. A.
Knight, Downton Castle, Wiltshire, England, and first fruited in 1815,
shortly after the Battle of Waterloo, hence its name. It was supposed
to be a cross between Yellow Spanish and May Duke. The variety was
brought to this country by Honorable John Lowell of Newton, Massachusetts,
though it was described by Prince in 1828 from European fruit books.
The following description is compiled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree vigorous, thrifty, rather irregular and spreading, productive; branchlets thick,
stocky, grayish; leaves large, drooping, wavy; margin slightly serrate; flowers large;
stamens shorter than the pistil.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the last of June or early in July; large, obtuse-cordate, broad at the
base, convex on one side, flattened on the other; stem one and one-half to two inches in
length, slender; color dark purplish-red becoming nearly black at maturity; skin thin;
flesh purplish-red becoming darker next to the stone, firm but tender, juicy, fine flavored,
sweet; good in quality; stone separating readily from the pulp, small, roundish-ovate,
compressed.</p></blockquote>

<p>White Bigarreau is a cherry of the past, having been considered one
of the good sorts of a century ago. Rivers, the English pomologist,
believed it to have come originally from Russia. It is reputed to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
brought to America from France by Chancellor Livingston of Revolutionary
fame. Thacher, in 1822, described the variety first under its present
name. The variety, as the synonymy shows, has been grown under many
names both in America and Europe. In 1845, according to Downing,
this cherry was common in the neighborhood of New York and Philadelphia
but since Downing's time no one seems to have mentioned it. The
variety is usually spoken of in the United States as neither hardy nor
productive. The fruit books describe it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tree medium in size, spreading, very tender, unproductive; leaves narrow, waved.</p>

<p>Fruit matures the last of June or early in July; large to very large, heart-shaped,
somewhat pointed; color yellowish-white with a bright red cheek, mottled; flesh very
firm, breaking, pleasantly flavored, sweet; very good in quality; stone separating readily

<p>White Heart is mentioned in <i>The Cherries of New York</i> only because
of its reputation in Europe and the frequent references, therefore, that
American cherry-growers see to it in European publications. Bunyard and
Thomas, in the reference given, speak of it as one of the best and most
profitable cherries grown in the famous Kent cherry orchards. Early
American horticulturists describe it but it seems not to have been widely
grown in America and has probably long since passed from cultivation.
It failed, according to Elliott, because it was a "variable and uncertain
bearer" and while an early cherry "not early enough to compete with
many new varieties."</p>

<p>White Heart seems to have been mentioned first by Miller in 1734.
A little later it is found to be described in both Germany and France,
indicating that it must have been known and widely distributed before
the time given. It seems to have been brought to America before the
War of the Revolution and to have been grown in this country under the
several different names which are given in the list of synonyms. The
following description is compiled:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>Windsor is the standard late Bigarreau and one of the most profitable
of the hard-fleshed cherries grown in New York. Both fruit and trees
deserve the approbation of cherry-growers. In color the cherries meet the
market demand, buyers preferring a dark-colored Sweet Cherry. None
would find fault with the appearance of Windsor. The flesh is firm and the
product stands harvesting and shipping well and at a season of the year
when brown-rot is usually rife this variety is fairly free from this
scourge of the Sweet Cherry. The quality is from good to very good,
equaled but not surpassed by others of its class. But it is in its tree-characters
that the superiority of Windsor is best shown. The trees have the
reputation of being the hardiest of the Bigarreaus and of thriving in many
soils. They are usually fruitful. To offset these merits, the trees have two
or three rather serious faults. Thus, they do not come in bearing early;
they are tall and upright in growth, being almost fastigiate, making it
difficult to harvest the crop; and the load of fruit is too much clustered.
Cherry-growers agree that the worst of all pests of this fruit is the robin
and that the Windsor, for some reason or other, is the freest of its kind
from this and other thieving birds. From the behavior of the variety
in New York, we can heartily join with practically all who are growing this
variety in recommending it as a late, market Sweet Cherry.</p>

<p>Windsor originated in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century on the
farm of James Dougall, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and was introduced
to fruit-growers in 1881 by Ellwanger &amp; Barry, Rochester, New York.
It has been planted extensively in many sections of this country for both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
home and market use and is now offered for sale by a large number of
nurserymen. The American Pomological Society added Windsor to its
fruit catalog list in 1885 and the variety still holds a place there. Though
rather widely known in the United States the commercial culture of this
variety is almost wholly confined to New York. It seems as yet not to
have found its way to Europe, a fact to be regretted, for its many good
qualities would soon make it known in the Old World where the Sweet
Cherry is better grown and more appreciated than in America.</p>

<p>Wood is preeminently a Sweet Cherry for the amateur, having many
qualities that fit it for the home orchard and but few to commend it to
commercial growers. The trees are a little tender to cold, are not quite
productive enough to make the variety profitable and are, too, somewhat
fastidious as to soils. To offset these defects, they are vigorous and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
healthy and bear early. But the chief fault of the cherry from the cherry-grower's
standpoint is to be found in the fruit. The flesh is soft and the
cherries will not stand handling in harvesting and shipping and are very
susceptible to brown-rot and crack badly in wet weather. Wood has
special merit in the home collection, however, because of its earliness, its
beautiful appearance and delicious flavor. It is one of the first of the
Sweet Cherries, is large and, as the color-plate shows, is a beautiful yellowish-white
tinted with shades of crimson, with conspicuous russet dots&mdash;a
beautiful fruit. The flesh separates readily from the skin, is tender, juicy,
with an abundance of colorless juice and a flavor that has given it the
reputation, wherever grown in America, of being one of the best in quality.
It would be hard to name another cherry better suited for small plantations
and it is to be hoped that it will long be kept in the gardens of connoisseurs
of good fruit.</p>

<p>Wood is one of the best of Professor J. P. Kirtland's<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> seedlings. It
was raised by him in 1842 at Cleveland, Ohio, and named in honor of
Reuben Wood, at one time Governor of Ohio. In 1856, it was added to
the fruit list of the American Pomological Society where it still remains,
being changed in 1909 to Wood with Governor Wood as a synonym. Its
popularity is shown in the United States by the fact that practically every
nurseryman in this country lists this variety.

<p>Wragg is either English Morello or a strain of that variety. Trees
on the grounds of this Station are identical with English Morello but it
may be that here, and occasionally elsewhere, the older sort has been substituted
for Wragg. In Iowa, where the new variety is most largely grown,
pomologists claim that it is distinct and that it is an improvement on English
Morello. Professor J. L. Budd, an authority on Russian cherries, believed
that this sort is distinct and of Russian origin having, according to him,
been brought to America by Ellwanger &amp; Barry of Rochester, New York,
in an importation of Russian trees. Captain C. L. Watrous of Des Moines,
Iowa, another prominent pomologist of that State, was of the opinion that
Wragg came to light on the grounds of J. Wragg, Waukee, Iowa, as a sprout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
from another tree. Colonel G. B. Brackett, pomologist of the United
States Department of Agriculture, who visited Mr. Wragg's place some
years ago and compared the new cherry with the English Morello, could
find no distinguishing characters between the two. On the other hand,
Mr. Wragg insisted that they were distinct. The American Pomological
Society calls Wragg and English Morello the same. Those who believe
that the two are distinct say that the fruit of Wragg is larger, the trees
hardier and that the cherries ripen a little later than those of English
Morello. With the information now at hand it is impossible to say here
whether or not Wragg is distinct. A compiled description taken from the
text describing this cherry is so unsatisfactory that we offer none and refer
the reader to that of English Morello from which it differs but little, if
at all.</p>

<p>For centuries Yellow Spanish must have been the best of all the
Bigarreaus and it is only in comparatively late years that it has had rivals.
Even yet in tree-characters it is hardly equaled, surpassing Windsor, which
has a notable tree, in several respects and falling short of it only in hardiness.
The trees are large,&mdash;perhaps the largest of all the varieties of
<i>Prunus avium</i>,&mdash;having an upright-spreading top which gives a large bearing
surface and forms a canopy of splendid foliage. The trees are vigorous,
bear abundantly and regularly and come in bearing young, with the crop
well distributed and not in clusters as is the case and the fault of Windsor.
Unfortunately, the cherries, though very good in most characters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
do not come up to the trees in points of superiority. They are rather
smaller than those of Napoleon, the greatest competitor of Yellow Spanish,
and are more subject to attacks of brown-rot than several others of the
Bigarreaus. As may be seen by comparing the color-plates, however,
Yellow Spanish is rather the handsomer of the two cherries, the crimson
color being more evenly distributed and the skin not having the mottled
appearance of Napoleon. In quality Yellow Spanish is the better of the
two, having tenderer flesh and a sweeter and richer flavor. Yellow Spanish
is notable in the nursery for its strong, upright growth and its large leaves,
the leaves of no other cherry attaining so great a size. In blossoming
time the variety may be distinguished by the whiteness of the blossoms
as they open and a reddish tint as they drop. It is a mid-season cherry,
ripening after Wood and a few days before Napoleon. Despite the great
age of the variety it still remains one of the best, furnishing proof, by the
way, that varieties of cherries do not degenerate with age. In New York
Yellow Spanish cannot be spared from either home or commercial plantings.</p>

<p>Yellow Spanish is so old and so widely disseminated that its origin
can only be conjectured. From the name we naturally infer a Spanish
nativity and yet it is almost equally well known as Bigarreau, a word of
French derivation. Under the last name French pomologists believe that
they trace its history to the First Century of the Christian Era as the
variety described by Pliny under the name Cerasum Duracinum. The
Germans and Austrians certainly knew this variety in the Eighteenth
Century and probably much earlier, an inference to be drawn from the
references given. Parkinson, the English herbalist, described a cherry in
1629 which he called the Biguarre Cherrie which later came to be known
as the Bigarreau or Graffion by English writers and which we now know
to be Yellow Spanish. Seven years later Gerarde described a Spanish
cherry the description of which is not unlike our Yellow Spanish. Miller
and Forsyth, English writers, also at an early date described a Spanish
cherry which may be the fruit of this discussion.</p>

<p>Fortunately we are well informed as to the history of Yellow Spanish
in America. Prince, one of the most accurate of American pomologists,
in 1832, gave the following historical account of the Graffion, or Yellow
Spanish: "This tree was imported from London by the father of the
author, in the year 1802, under the name Yellow Spanish, and one of the
original trees is now growing in his garden, where it produces abundantly,
and there is little doubt that from his stock have originated most of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
trees of this kind now in our country, as he has taken much pains to
recommend it." Why Prince and other Americans came to call the variety
introduced by the elder Prince of Europe as Yellow Spanish, as Bigarreau
and Graffion, does not appear unless the younger Prince wanted to make
the name in this country conform to that in most common usage in England
at the time. Besides the names already given, Yellow Spanish has been
rather widely grown in America as Ox Heart and White Caroon. This
variety was placed on the recommended list of the National Congress of
Fruit Growers, which afterwards became the American Pomological Society,
in 1848, under the name Bigarreau. The name was changed in 1897 to
Yellow Spanish and it now appears on the list of that organization as
Spanish.</p>

persons claiming the honor of its discovery. Its value was discussed at the meetings of
the Société Pomologique de France in 1909 and 1911 when it was adjudged by leading
French pomologists to be one of the earliest of all varieties, earlier than Lyons, and showing
high commercial possibilities. Tree handsome in type of growth, with open, somewhat
erect branches; leaves large, deeply serrate; fruit very large; color beautiful clear red
becoming darker at maturity; flesh white, breaking, very firm, with uncolored juice,
sweet, very refreshing; stone medium to small; season in France very early.</dd>

<dd>The original tree of this variety was brought from the south of France by the father
of George Walsh, Charlestown, Massachusetts. The tree came into bearing about 1840.
In 1841, fruits were exhibited from trees introduced into American collections from Italy
as New Large Black Bigarreau, and were thought by several people to be the Black
Bigarreau of Savoy. Until 1857, all writers held these two varieties to be distinct but
Downing then declared them to be the same and on his authority we combine the two.
Tree vigorous, handsome; fruit large, regular, cordate, slightly obtuse; stem long,

often confused, differences could be noted especially as to firmness of flesh and smallness
of pit. Fruit large, obtuse-cordate, compressed; suture distinct; stem slender, short;

Richmond in size, shape, season and color, differing only in its flesh being more firm, its
pit smaller, and the tree less productive; of no value commercially.</dd>

<dd>Produced from seed about 1800, by Büttner. As one of the latest of all cherries, it
was at one time considered of value for culinary purposes and for a time was grown to
a limited extent in this country. The American Pomological Society placed it on its
fruit catalog list in 1862 but dropped it in 1869. Tree hardy, productive; fruit often
hangs to the tree till October, large, round, somewhat oblate; suture indistinct; apex
depressed; stem long, slender; cavity shallow; skin thin but firm, reddish-brown, separating
easily from the pulp; flesh light red, reticulated with whitish fibers, firm, breaking, juicy,
sweet, rich, mingled with pleasant subacid; quality good; stone large, oval, semi-clinging;
ripens the last of August and early September.

<dd>Leroy states that this variety was long ago well known in France. Because it was
grown in the neighborhood of Angers and Saint-Laud, and was of the Montmorency type,
Leroy says it was locally named Cerisier Montmorency Hâtif de Saint Laud. He is doubtful
whether it existed before the Eighteenth Century; Duhamel was the first to describe
it in 1768. The tree resembles the Cluster cherry and is probably but a variation of the
Cerise Commune type. Tree small; fruit generally attached in threes, of medium size,
globular, compressed at the stem; cavity rather deep; apex small, somewhat prominent;
stem of medium size, unequal in length; skin transparent, clear red, deeper when mature;
flesh tender, white, juicy, sugary, strongly acidulated; stone medium in size, roundish,
turgid; ripens the middle of June. Its graceful habit and productiveness make it a favorite
for ornamental purposes.</dd>

named because of the peculiar and lively mingling of sweet and acid in its flavor. Tree
very hardy, vigorous, bearing regularly, and withstanding the attacks of rot and blight.
Fruit of medium size, roundish-cordate, slightly angular; stem moderately long; cavity
shallow, flat; skin lively brick-red, inclining to pink; flesh amber, juicy, sprightly, rich;
ripens the middle of June.</dd>

<dd>Champion is one of many seedlings of the Manitoba Sand, a native Canadian cherry
named and described in 1898, by Wm. Saunders of the Canadian Experimental Farms.
Fruit large, very dark red, nearly black when ripe; flesh sweet, nearly free from astringency;
quality good; ripens in Manitoba the last of August.</dd>

<dd>Chapman was grown by W. H. Chapman of Napa, California, and is supposed to be
a seedling of Black Tartarian, surpassing that variety in size and earliness. By some
horticulturists Chapman and California Advance are considered identical, but most growers,
particularly in California, declare the two to be distinct. Fruit matures early; very large,
roundish, purplish-black; stem long, slender; flesh slightly tender; very good in quality;
stone small.</dd>

<dd>Cheresoto is a cross between the Sand Cherry and the De Soto plum from the South
Dakota Experiment Station. The tree resembles the plum in growth but the fruit, in
looks and flavor, is like that of the Sand Cherry. Fruit rather long with a prickle at the
apex; about one and three-eighths inches in diameter; skin black with a bluish bloom,
thin, free from acerbity; flesh yellowish-green, sprightly; pit clinging.

<dd>This variety was raised from the seed of an Ox Heart by William Prince, Flushing,
New York, and at first was called China Heart. W. R. Prince in his <i>Pomological Manual</i>
of 1832, calls it China Bigarreau as it is more of the Bigarreau than of the Heart type
of cherries. Tree vigorous, large; fruit medium in size, roundish or oval-cordate, with a
distinct suture; stem long, slender, set in a shallow cavity; skin when fully ripe, glossy red
mottled with lighter red; flesh firm, somewhat melting, with a sweet, rich, peculiar flavor;
ripens just after Black Tartarian and forms a link between it and the later varieties;
very productive.</dd>

<dd>Leroy states that Coularde has been known since 1740 but is often confused with
other cherries. According to Leroy, this variety was reintroduced as a novelty about
1864, under the name Belle d'Orleans. American writers, however, list a Belle d'Orleans
as early as 1850, which is of the Guigne type rather than the Griotte. Tree the largest
of its class; branches strong and straight; blooms profusely; fruit large, round; skin red;
flesh firm, reddish-white, sweet, agreeable; ripens the end of June. The pistils being
much longer than the stamens, many flowers are never fertilized which gives the blossoms
a blighted appearance.</dd>

The fruit is recognized from others of its class by its small size, its honey
sweetness, its peculiar color and its transparent skin. Fruit more round than cordate, with
a shallow suture; stem slender, inserted in a narrow, shallow cavity; skin yellow washed
with red, transparent allowing the pit to be visible; flesh yellowish-white, tender, very
juicy, very sweet if ripened thoroughly; stone small, round, almost free when ripe; season

<dd>Thomas Rivers of Sawbridgeworth, England, is given credit for this variety as a
strain of the old Early White Heart. Leroy, however, states that his grandfather propagated
this cherry under the name Cerise Panache or Suisse, as early as 1790 but without
knowing its origin. He dropped the <i>précoce</i> because other varieties ripened long before
this one. Tree vigorous, erect, productive; fruit borne in threes, medium in size, obtuse-cordate,
slightly compressed; suture wide; stem long, slender, set in a straight, deep cavity;
skin firm, medium thick, changing from lively red to reddish-brown; flesh yellowish, tender,
cracking, with uncolored juice, sweet, aromatic; pit large for the fruit; season early.</dd>

<dd>This variety originated a generation or more ago in Virginia and was known there and
in neighboring states as Early May. Later, it became widely disseminated in the Middle
West where it was often confused with Early Richmond, Late Kentish and Montmorency.
Early May should not be confused with a European cherry of the same name
formerly grown upon the continent but now seldom seen. The fruit of the American sort
is much like Early Richmond though of inferior quality and is now probably wholly
replaced by the latter variety.</dd>

<dd>The tree of this variety, unlike many other double-flowering sorts, attains but moderate
size, in many cases is but a bush or shrub. The blossoms are exceedingly double,
very showy, with a slight tinge of pink on opening, the blooming season extending over
three or four weeks. Frequently the blossoms have small leaflets intermingled with the
petals, while often a smaller flower appears to rise out of the center of another. The
trees very seldom, if ever, bear. Truchsess reports having fruited it twice in ten years.
The early English writers make brief mention of several double-flowering sorts which
have been included under this variety.</dd>

<dd>The home of this cherry is not known, it having been greatly confused with other
double-flowering sorts. The flowers have a double row of from fifteen to twenty petals and
often have two pistils, especially on the older trees. These generally bear twin-fruits though
often the pistils are changed into small, green leaves, in which case the flowers are neither
large nor attractive. The tree is of the Amarelle type, small, blooming profusely; fruit
moderately round, compressed on one side with a shallow suture; stem long, stout; cavity
wide; skin clear red, becoming darker and flecked with brown; flesh whitish, tender, juicy,
sweet, pleasing, subacid at first; stone oval, bluntly pointed, often small and round, free
when fully ripe; ripens the middle of July.</dd>

<dd>A few authors describe this cherry as Volgers; the Volger described by Knoop in 1771,
however, is a distinct variety. Duhamel's variety, Cerise-Guigne, is possibly the same.
Fruit large, roundish, truncate at the base, in unfavorable seasons the apex and sides are
strongly compressed, with a noticeable suture; stem stout, long, set in a wide cavity; skin
deep reddish-purple, glossy, tender; flesh delicate, sweet with a piquant taste; stone small,

<dd>This variety was imported into this country by Professor J. L. Budd in 1883 from
North Silesia. The Montreal Horticultural Society believes two forms exist, one from
North Silesia being perfectly hardy while another from Metz, Germany, is far less so.
Tree productive; branches drooping; fruit above medium in size, roundish-oblate; suture
shallow; stem long; cavity small; skin thin, glossy, dark red at maturity; flesh tender,
tinted with abundant, uncolored juice, acidulated; stone large; matures the last of June

<dd>Unlike the rest of its class, this cherry has tender flesh but is a Bigarreau in tree-habit,
leaf and in appearance of fruit, and is therefore classified as such. The variety is a seedling
raised by Thomas Ingram of the Frogmore Royal Gardens at Windsor, Berkshire, England.
Tree bears freely in clusters; fruit large, obtuse-cordate, slightly compressed, with
a faint suture; stem long, set in a small cavity; skin waxen, orange-yellow, with a network
of red and a blush of deeper red on the sunny side; flesh of a primrose color, very
tender, translucent, rich, sweet; stone spoon-shaped, indented on one side; season early but
short.</dd>

on both sides, slightly drawn in at the apex and base; suture distinct on one side; stem
long, inserted in a shallow cavity; skin yellow, blushed and faintly splashed with red where
exposed; flesh pale yellow with a slight red tinge underneath the skin, moderately firm,

under the number 32674. It is claimed to be a hybrid between an early Vladimir and a
variety of Sweet Cherry called "White Winkler." It possesses excellent shipping and
keeping qualities. This cherry has stood the severe winters of Central Russia very well
and may be expected to thrive in parts of the Middle West and where the climate is more
or less semi-arid. Tree vigorous, upright, with few side branches; trunk smooth and
clean; fruit large, pale red, with a fresh sour-sweet flavor; ripening about the end of

it Late Black Bigarreau under which name it is now known in English and American
pomologies. Tree large, vigorous, upright, productive; fruit medium to large, cordate; suture

Anglaise hâtive. It is probably of English origin, but the name is misleading as the fruit
is only moderately large; attached in pairs, globular; stem stout, short, shallowly inserted;
skin transparent, yellowish, partly covered with red; flesh yellowish, tender, slightly fibrous,
very juicy, sugary, sprightly; pit small, roundish, plump, adhering to the stem; ripens
the last of June.</dd>

<dd>Red Jacket was raised in 1842 by Professor J. P. Kirtland, Cleveland, Ohio, from a
pit of Yellow Spanish, crossed with Black Tartarian, Black Mazzard, or May Duke. It
was formerly grown commercially in this country and Europe because of its productiveness
and quality. Tree very vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive; fruit
large, long, obtuse-cordate; stem rather long, slender; skin thin, pale red becoming rather
bright red; flesh yellowish-white, half-tender, juicy, pleasant, somewhat astringent until
fully ripe when it becomes sweet; good in quality; stone medium in size; ripens in late
mid-season.</dd>

grounds. The name Schatten is derived from the mirror-like reflection of the glossy skin
when exposed to the sun. From the description it seems to differ from the Brusseler

Kirschwasser as a commercial article is made chiefly on the upper Rhine from the wild black Sweet
Cherry (<i>Prunus avium</i>). In its manufacture, fruit&mdash;flesh and kernels&mdash;is mashed into a pulp which
is allowed to ferment. By distillation from this fermented pulp a colorless liqueur is obtained.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
Maraschino is a liqueur, or cordial, made from the fruit and leaves of the small, sour, black Marasca
cherry. The product comes chiefly from Zara, the capital of the Austrian province of Dalmatia, where
it has been made and exported for over 200 years. Such accounts of the process of making maraschino
as have become public seem to agree that the liqueur is a distillation of a compote made from the fruit
and young leaves. When ripe the cherries are picked early in the morning and sent at once to the distillery
where the stones are extracted by machinery. The leaves are cut, pressed and added to the fruit with
sugar and alcohol. This mixture is allowed to ferment for six months or thereabouts and from it is then
distilled maraschino. It is then stored in cellars for three years before being placed on the markets.
In both Europe and America there are many imitations of the maraschino liqueur in which neither fruit
nor foliage of the Marasca nor any other cherry has any part.</p>

<p>According to the Dalmatians all attempts to improve the Marasca cherry by culture have failed.
They say, too, that it will not thrive elsewhere than in Dalmatia. Under culture, the fruits and leaves
lose their distinctive aroma and taste as they do on any but the native soil of the variety. The poorer,
sparser and more rocky the ferruginous soil, the wilder the tree, the smaller and sourer the cherries, the
better the maraschino liqueur&mdash;so the present makers say.</p>

<p>Since considerable quantities of cherries are put up in America in maraschino, or its imitation, and the
manufacture of such products is a growing industry, the following ruling by the Board of Food and Drug
Inspection of the United States Department of Agriculture, taken from Food Inspection Decision 141, is
of interest to growers, canners and users of cherries:</p>

<p>"In considering the products prepared from the large light-colored cherry of the Napoleon Bigarreau,
or Royal Anne type, which are artificially colored and flavored and put up in a sugar sirup, flavored with
various materials, the Board has reached the conclusion that this product is not properly entitled to be
called 'Maraschino Cherries,' or 'Cherries in Maraschino.' If, however, these cherries are packed in
a sirup, flavored with maraschino alone, it is the opinion of the Board that they would not be misbranded,
if labeled 'Cherries, Maraschino Flavor,' or 'Maraschino Flavored Cherries.' If these cherries are
packed in maraschino liqueur there would be no objection to the phrase 'Cherries in Maraschino.' When
these artificially colored cherries are put up in a sirup flavored in imitation of maraschino, even though
the flavoring may consist in part of maraschino, it would not be proper to use the word 'Maraschino'
in connection with the product unless preceded by the word 'Imitation.' They may, however, be labeled
to show that they are a preserved cherry, artificially colored and flavored.</p>

<p>"The presence of artificial coloring or flavoring matter, of any substitute for cane sugar, and the
presence and amount of benzoate of soda, when used in these products must be plainly stated upon the
label in the manner provided in Food Inspection Decisions Nos. 52 and 104."</p></div>

The species are given as classified by Koehne, <i>Plantae Wilsonianae</i> Pt. <b>2</b>:237-271. 1912. The
liberty has been taken of changing the form of Koehne's citations to conform to that used at this Station.
For the sake of brevity some of the citations of the original author have been omitted. Space does not
permit the publication of Koehne's system of classification. This may be found in <i>Plantae Wilsonianae</i>
Pt. <b>2</b>:226-237. 1912.</p>

<p>Conservative botanists will hardly accept all of Koehne's species, in describing which the author tells
us he labored under the difficulty of paucity of material and that as more material comes to hand there
must, therefore, be revisions. These species are provisionally accepted in <i>The Cherries of New York</i>
under the belief that botany and horticulture are best served by giving names freely so that all forms
to which reference may need to be made may thus be better identified.</p>

<p>The botanical student of Cerasus is referred to Schneider's comprehensive discussion of Prunus in
his <i>Handbuch der Laubholzkunde</i> <b>1</b>:589-637. 1906 and <b>2</b>:973-993; also Koehne's monographs of Cerasus,
Sargent, C. S., <i>Plantae Wilsonianae</i> Pt. <b>2</b>:197-271. 1912. Profitable though it might be, space does not
permit in <i>The Cherries of New York</i> a botanical discussion of other than the species cultivated for their
fruits.</p></div>

In <i>The Country-Man's New Art of Planting and Grafting</i>, written by Leonard Mascall, 1652, the
writer says, "Sower Cherries ... will grow of stones, but better it shall be to take of the small Cions
which do come from the roots; then plant them.</p>

<p>"Ye must have respect unto the Healme Cherry, [a sweet cherry of the time] which is graft on the
wild Gomire [Mazzard] which is another kind of great Cherry, and whether you do prune them or not,
it is not materiall; for they dure a long time."</p>

<p>R. A. Austen, in his <i>Treatise of Fruit Trees</i>, 1653, writes, "Concerning Stocks fit for Cherry-trees,
I account the black Cherry stock (Mazzard) the best to graft any kind of Cherry upon. Yet some say
the red Cherry stock is best for May-Cherries. But the black Cherry stocks are goodly straight Plants
full of sap and become greater trees than the red Cherry trees."</p>

<p>John Reid, <i>The Scots Gard'ner</i>, 1683, writes, "Dwarfe Cherries on the Morella, or on the common
Red Cherrie. Or on that Red geen which is more Dwarffish than the black."</p>

<p>John Lawrence, <i>The Clergyman's Recreation</i>, 1714, declared that, "Black Cherries (Mazzard) are
the only Stocks, whereon to raise all, the several sorts of Cherries."</p></div>

do not succeed well on any but the black Mazard stocks, but round or duke cherries do as well on Morello
stocks, which are often preferred from their being less liable to the cracks in the bark, from frost and sun
on the southwest side; this injury may be almost effectually prevented by planting on the east side of
board fences or buildings, or by fixing an upright board on the southwest side of each tree in open
situations.</p>

<p>"The best stocks are raised from stones planted in the nursery. Stocks raised from suckers of
old trees, will always generate suckers, which are injurious and very troublesome in gardens: diseases of
old or worn out varieties, are likewise perpetuated by the use of suckers for stocks." Coxe <i>Fruit
Trees</i> <b>1817</b>:253.</p></div>

"The cultivated cherry, when reared from the seed, is much disposed to deviate from the variety
of the original fruit, and, of course, they are propagated by budding or grafting on cherry stocks: budding
is most generally preferred, as the tree is less apt to suffer from oozing of the gum than when grafted. The
stocks are obtained by planting the seeds in a nursery, and the seedlings are afterwards transplanted.
Those kinds which are called heart cherries are said to succeed best on the black mazard stock; but for
the round kind, the Morello stocks are preferred, on account of their being the least subject to worms,
or to cracks in the bark, from frost and heat of the sun." Thacher <i>American Orchardist</i> <b>1822</b>:212.</p></div>

"So the good species and their varieties are perpetuated and multiplied by grafting upon the
Merisier, upon the Cerisier with round fruit, and upon the Cerisier de Sainte-Lucie [Mahaleb]. All the
Cerisiers succeed well upon the Merisier and it is the only subject which is suited to the high-headed trees.
It has the advantage of not sending forth any or very few suckers. The Cerisier de Sainte-Lucie has the
same advantage. It receives very well the graft of all species of cherries and adapts itself to the worst
soils." Duhamel <i>Traite des Arbres Fruitiers</i> <b>1</b>:197. 1768.</p></div>

"Varieties of the cherry are continued by grafting or budding on stocks of the black or wild red
cherries, which are strong shooters, and of a longer duration than any of the garden kinds. Some graft
on the Morello for the purpose of dwarfing the tree, and rendering it more prolific; but the most effectual
dwarfing stock is the mahaleb, which, however, will not succeed in the generality of soils in Britain.
Dubreuil of Rouen recommends the wild cherry for clayey and light soils, and the mahaleb for soils of
a light, sandy or chalky nature. The stones of the cultivated cherry are commonly, but improperly,
substituted for those of the wild sort, as being more easily procured." Loudon <i>Enc. of Gard.</i> <b>1824</b>:924.</p></div>

"When dwarf trees are required, the <i>Morello</i> seedlings are used as stocks; or when very dwarf trees
are wished the Perfumed Cherry, (Cerasus Mahaleb) is employed; but as standards are almost universally
preferred, these are seldom seen here. Dwarfs in the nursery must be headed back the second year, in
order to form lateral shoots near the ground." Downing <i>Fruit Trees of America</i> <b>1845</b>:164.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">48</a>
"The stocks used for this purpose (to dwarf cherries) are the "Perfumed Cherry" or <i>Prunus
Mahaleb</i>, which also possesses the advantage of flourishing on heavy clay ground. The grafts will usually
grow quite vigorously for two or three seasons, but they soon form dwarf, prolific bushes." Thomas

"The principal stocks used for the cherry are the <i>mazzard</i> for standard orchard trees, and the mahaleb
for garden pyramids and dwarfs.</p>

<p>"The <i>Mahaleb</i> (Cerasus mahaleb) is a small tree with glossy, deep green foliage. The fruit is black,
about the size of a marrow-fat pea, and quite bitter. It blossoms and bears fruit when about three years
old. It is considerably cultivated in many parts of Europe, as an ornamental lawn tree. There are very
few bearing trees in this country yet; consequently nearly all the stocks used are imported, or grown from
imported seeds." Barry <i>The Fruit Garden</i> <b>1851</b>:115, 117.</p></div>

"<i>Dwarf Trees.</i>&mdash;Are produced by propagating the Sweet or Duke varieties on the Mahaleb, or
Morello roots. They should in all cases be worked just at the crown of the root, as it is there a union
is best formed; and also, by means of pruning, (see page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>) they should be made to form heads branching
immediately from the ground." Elliott <i>Fr. Book</i> <b>1854</b>:185.</p></div>

"I will here say that one year with another we succeed as well in grafting on Mazzard roots as we
do with pear on pear roots, and nearly as well as with apple on apple roots. In some cases since the
appearance of the graft-box fungus our success has been more complete with the cherry than with the
apple. This success is due to careful compliance with two main guiding rules, founded on the nature
of cherry wood: (1) Keep the scions dry until used. If given an opportunity they will absorb water
enough to start the buds and form a callus at the base. In this condition they will fail to unite with the
root. (2) After grafting, pack in boxes with sand or moss and store in a root cave, kept uniformly cool
by opening at night and keeping closed during the day. If the buds start prior to the time of planting
in nursery they will usually fail to grow. It may prove useful to add, that the sprouts from deeply set
trees on Mazzard root will always be true to the varieties planted, and the surface roots can be utilized
for root cuttings, as noted on a future page." <i>Ia. Sta. Bul.</i> <b>10</b>:424. 1890.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">80</a> Little is known of the early life of Seth and Henderson Lewelling. They were of Welsh ancestry
and both were born in Salem, North Carolina, Henderson on the 25th of April, 1809, and Seth on the 6th
day of March, 1819. Henderson died in California December 28th, 1878, while Seth died in Milwaukee,
continued:  Oregon, February 21st, 1897. When the boys were still very young their parents moved from North
Carolina to Ohio and founded the town of Salem in Ross County; later they moved to Indiana where their
father established a nursery and became one of the pioneer fruit-growers of what was then the West and
here again they founded a town of Salem. We next hear of Henderson Lewelling in Salem, Henry County,
Iowa, the town of his naming, with the statement that in 1837 he planted a small nursery of 35 varieties
of apples and some peach, plum and cherry trees.</p>

<p>The history of the Lewellings now becomes more definite for we have it from Seth Lewelling<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
(we spell the name as does he and not "Luelling" as do many in writing of him) that in March, 1847,
Henderson Lewelling planted an assortment of apples, pears, peaches, plums and cherries and loaded
them into two wagons and started to Oregon. This traveling nursery was on the road from March to
November and one can imagine the labor of watering and caring for the trees in this trip across mountains
and plains. Henderson Lewelling formed a partnership with William Meek under the firm name of
Meek &amp; Lewelling, Milwaukee, Oregon. Seth joined his brother in the fall of 1850 bringing with him
from the East a considerable quantity of fruit seed. For the next few years their nursery operations were
on a large scale, over 100,000 grafts being planted in 1853. From time to time they made new importations
of plants and fruit seeds from the East. Seth says that his brother quit the business and moved to
California in 1853 and we hear no more of him until his death in 1878. In 1857, the partnership between
Meek and Seth Lewelling was dissolved leaving the latter the owner of the Milwaukee nurseries. It was
in 1860 that Seth Lewelling raised his first seedling cherry, the Republican, called by him Black
Republican, which was sold to George Walling of Oswego and Mr. Hanson of East Portland, the proceeds
bringing Lewelling $500. Mr. Lewelling counts the Republican and Bing cherries and the Golden Prune
as his most notable contributions to pomology.</p>

<p>The Lewellings are types of fruit-breeders who have done noble work for pomology in the settlement
of all our states&mdash;men of for indomitable courage and will who have bred and grown fruits throughout their
lives in spite of every adversity. Few other men labored longer and more devotedly to improve the
cherry than Seth Lewelling.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">82</a> Elliott's <i>American Fruit Growers Guide</i>, published in 1858 and dedicated to Professor Jared P.
Kirtland, was one of the notable pomological books of its day. Cherry growers, in particular, owe Elliott
a debt of gratitude for the publicity that he gave to Kirtland's cherries, having described in his book 20
of the sorts originated by Professor Kirtland. Beside his fruit book he published <i>Popular Deciduous
and Evergreen Trees</i> (1868), <i>Handbook for Fruit-growers</i> (1876) and <i>Handbook of Practical Landscape Gardening</i>
(1877). He also served pomologists well for many years, at various times, from 1850 to 1873, as the
secretary of the American Pomological Society. Franklin Reuben Elliott was born in Guilford, Connecticut,
April 27, 1817. We know, from complimentary speeches, accepted by Elliott, that he was
a descendant of John Eliot, "The Apostle of the Indians." As a young man he engaged with a brother
in New York as an importer of dry goods, the firm being rated at half a million dollars. Financial ruin
came through a disastrous fire and, in 1836, Elliott went to Newburgh and was employed by A. J. Downing
from whom he imbibed his knowledge and much of his love for pomology and horticulture. A roving
disposition and dissipated habits led him to leave Downing for a position with a relative near Cincinnati
who was a market-gardener. A ready pen seems from this time on to have been his chief means of livelihood
for we find him successively in Cleveland, Ohio, and St. Louis, Missouri, in newspaper work; after
a few years in each place he wandered to Washington where he was employed in the Agricultural Department
of the Patent Office illustrating American fruits. From his hand in the Patent Office reports and
from his fruit book, came some of the most accurate and beautiful representations of the fruits of this
continent. It is probable that while in Washington he began work on his <i>Fruit Growers Guide</i>, the time
for which, he tells us in his preface, took ten years. Social infirmities seem to have cost him his position
in Washington and his last employment was with the <i>Cleveland Herald</i>, after which comes the record of
his death and burial in a pauper's grave January 10, 1878. One of the most brilliant pomologists of his
time, his career seems again and again to have been checked by the weaknesses of his life; even so, he rendered
horticulture valuable services for which we must give him gratitude and honor.</p></div>

Jared P. Kirtland, M. D., though now less well known than some of his contemporaries, was one
of the great pomologists of his time and a man of notable achievements in other branches of natural history
as well. Professor Kirtland was born at Wallingford, Connecticut, November 10, 1793, and died at
East Rockport, near Cleveland, Ohio, December 11, 1877. For sixty years of a long life his avocation
was the production of new varieties of fruits and flowers and, though a half century has passed since he
ceased active work, the results of his labors are yet to be found in the gardens and orchards of the whole
country. In pomology he gave special attention to breeding grapes, raspberries, pears and cherries.
He achieved success, too, as a hybridizer of peonies and in the introduction of rare foreign magnolias.
Professor Kirtland is given credit as being the first horticulturist successfully to bud and graft magnolias,
an achievement which has made possible their cultivation under many conditions and to a degree of
excellence that otherwise could not be obtained. He was the founder of the Cleveland Society of Natural
History and was for many years its president. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society,
the highest recognition for scientific work to be obtained in his time in this country. He served as professor
in several medical schools and filled other places of honor and trust. From his boyhood we are
told that he was interested in natural history and was intimately acquainted with the plants and animals
of Ohio, having special knowledge of birds and fishes, the propagation of the latter being one of his hobbies.
In pomology we owe him most for the many new cherries he has given us, thirty varieties described in
<i>The Cherries of New York</i> having come from his breeding grounds. Among these are Wood, Pontiac,
Powhatan, Tecumseh, Osceola, Kirtland and Red Jacket, sorts scarcely surpassed for high quality and
grown commonly in America and to some extent wherever Sweet Cherries will thrive. His 84 years seem
to have been well ordered, given almost wholly for the good of the public, and his name should be cherished
by pomologists among those who have done most for fruits and fruit-growing on this continent.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_84" href="#FNanchor_84" class="label">84</a> Charles Downing, whose likeness we show in the frontispiece, was born at Newburgh, New York,
July 9, 1802. He spent his life in the place of his birth, dying January 18, 1885. His parents were natives
of Lexington, Massachusetts, who shortly before the birth of Charles Downing, the eldest son, came to
Newburgh, the father establishing a shop for the manufacture of wagons, a business which he soon
abandoned to become a nurseryman. Here, in the first successful nursery established in the region, were
trained Charles and Andrew Downing, receiving under the careful guidance of the father a knowledge
of the business and of fruits which with later self instruction made them the most distinguished pomologists
of their day. With the death of the father in 1822, before Charles had obtained his majority, the
responsibility of conducting the business and the support of the family devolved upon him. Andrew J.,
the younger brother, in 1834, at the age of 19, united with Charles in the management of the nursery
business under the firm name of C. &amp; A. J. Downing, a partnership which lasted only until 1839. Charles
continued in the nursery business for many years during which time he became the foremost pomologist
in the United States and eventually, about 1850, sold his holdings to devote himself to the study of varieties
of fruits and the revision of the <i>Fruits and Fruit Trees of America.</i> This great pomological book was
projected and published by Andrew but most of the work of the book as it is now known was done by
Charles in revising the original and adding to its many editions. It is and has long been, as all know,
the highest authority on American fruits. Naturally of an inquiring turn of mind Charles Downing
studied closely the qualities of the varieties that came under his observation and seldom described without
the fruit in hand. His variety orchard is said to have contained at one time 1,800 varieties of apples
and 1,000 pears with lesser numbers of the other fruits. A few trees of this wonderful collection still stand.
Charles Downing was one of the most modest and retiring of men, in his younger days delighting in the
things of which his brother wrote and seldom putting pen to paper until after his brother's death when
he became a regular contributor to horticultural publications over the signature "C. D." He was never
known to make a public speech. He earned his high distinction in American pomology by his accurate
and conscientious descriptions and discussions of varieties of fruits.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">85</a> Andrew Jackson Downing was born in Newburgh on the Hudson, the town in which he always lived
and which he loved, October 30, 1815. He perished while trying to save other passengers in the burning
of the steamer <i>Henry Clay</i> on the Hudson River, July 28, 1852, at the age of 37. Andrew Downing's
education was largely acquired from self instruction although he attended the schools of his native town
and the academy in the adjoining village of Montgomery. His father, a nurseryman, whose work was
mentioned in the sketch of Charles Downing, elder brother of Andrew, gave the younger son every opportunity
to cultivate an early developed taste for horticulture, botany and the natural sciences. When
but a youth he joined his brother Charles as partner in a nursery firm, a relationship maintained for but
a few years and which he severed to begin a career as a writer on landscape gardening and pomological
subjects. His first publication was a <i>Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening adapted
to North America, with a view to the Improvement of Country Residences, with Remarks on Rural Architecture</i>,
a book published in 1841, the author being but 26 years of age. The work passed into instant
popularity and is the word of authority which has told thousands of Americans what to do to make their
grounds beautiful. Within a few months so great was the success of the first venture that in response
to the demand he published his <i>Cottage Residences, a</i> companion book which was received with equal
favor, thus giving Andrew Downing first rank as an authority on rural art. In 1845 the <i>Fruits and Fruit
Trees of America</i>, then and now the chief pomological authority of this continent, was printed simultaneously
in London and New York, a second edition coming out in 1850. In 1846 Andrew Downing became
the founder and editor of the <i>Horticulturist</i>, which he continued to publish until his death. In 1849 he
wrote <i>Additional Notes and Hints about Building in the Country</i>, published in Wightwick's <i>Hints to Young
Architects.</i> The summer of 1850 was spent in England in the study of landscape gardening and rural
architecture from the result of which came his <i>Architecture of Country Houses.</i> His last work was the
editing of Mrs. Loudon's <i>Landscape Gardening for Ladies</i> though <i>Rural Essays</i> appeared after his death
as a collection of his writings with a memoir by George William Curtis and a <i>Letter to his Friends</i> by
Frederika Bremer. He was employed in planting the public grounds of the Capitol, the White House
and the Smithsonian Institution at Washington when he met his untimely death. Downing is the creator
of American landscape gardening and shares with his brother Charles the honor of being the most distinguished
pomologist of the country. In the epoch-making <i>Fruits and Fruit Trees of America</i> Andrew
Downing was the real genius, Charles Downing the conscientious and painstaking student who worked
out the details.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">86</a> Oregon has given to pomology two notable breeders of cherries, Seth Lewelling and C. E. Hoskins,
the subject of this sketch. Cyrus Edwin Hoskins was born on a farm in Clinton County, Ohio, July 3,
1842, and there he grew to manhood. Almost at the first call for men to defend the Union in the Civil
War, Mr. Hoskins responded and joined the 13th Ohio regiment, serving until the close of the war.
Returning to Ohio, he gave attention to fruit culture, testing many varieties of several fruits and producing
some new grapes and berries. In 1877 Mr. Hoskins moved to Newberg, Yamhill County, Oregon, settling
on new land and thus becoming a pioneer in the Northwest. His first pomological venture in Oregon
was in growing prunes, his orchard of this fruit being one of the first, and he is credited with having built
one of the first evaporators for the curing of prunes in America. For some years he maintained his prune
ranch and evaporator, developing a product that gave him the highest reputation in prune markets and
made him one of the leading authorities on this fruit in the United States. Early in his orchard work
in Oregon Mr. Hoskins began to produce new varieties of cherries and soon offered for sale a number of
promising seedlings of which Vesta, Lake, Occident, Stryker and Hoskins were most worthy. Unfortunately,
ill health in the family compelled Mr. Hoskins to move from Yamhill County, to which place, after
having spent several years in Jackson County, Oregon, and in the Hawaiian Islands, he returned with the
expectation of taking up his work in breeding cherries and prunes, but his death, August 18, 1908, occurred
before his work had been again well begun. The Pacific Northwest owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Hoskins
for the spendid part he played in developing the fruit industry of that region and pomologists the country
over owe him much for his labors in breeding cherries.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
